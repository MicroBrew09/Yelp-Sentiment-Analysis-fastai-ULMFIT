2,"I got the Matcha Chiffon cake and the Chai Latte. The chiffon cake was light and fluffy with great flavor, as for the latte, it was one of the greatest chai lattes I've ever had! Definitely a staple!"
2,"This place is less than OK I would give it a 1 1/2. When it first opened, my friends and I would go there after school a lot. The general tao is pretty good, but you realize its mostly fat and batter, and they use dark meat, which is fine I guess. The green curry was less than ok, the chicken is cut really weird, and I baically got only 5 pieces of chicken, and the curry was super watery, also it didnt come with rice or anything so I had to order that after. The chicken balls are alright, but mostly batter and the sweet and sour sauce is alright. In conclution I much prefer Mayflower over this restaurant. I prefer Mayflower's business over this place."
3,"Meh. 

That basically sums up my recent experience at El Trompo. Sure, the food was decent, and I appreciate the variety of jarritos available, but the service was blah and the whole thing was just overpriced. 

On the servers recommendation, I tried the first tacos on the list, with pork and pineapple (the name escapes me). They were alright, but kind of dry and really nothing special. I topped it with the guacamole that we were up-sold (I'm still not quite sure how that happened!).

When the bill came, I was pretty shocked - the guac was a whole $7!! For a tiny bowl!! Considering I didn't really want it in the first place, I was pretty unhappy. 

We also had to spend quite a bit of time getting our servers attention for water and the bill. 

Overall, not so impressed."
2,"Some of the best food we had during our stay was at ATG.  The bartender was great.  They have a really nice beer selection, including some of the local craft beers, rather than just the standard Rickards, Alex Keith, and Molson.

Definitely on the list of must stops next time we're in town."
2,"I stopped by twice. The first was before they released the matcha cheesecake, so I grabbed a couple of the regular matcha madeleines. I thought they were very buttery with the perfect hint of matcha.

The second time I stopped by with the sole purpose of grabbing a cheesecake. The lineup wasn't that bad. I had to wait 10 minutes while the cheesecakes were baking in the oven. I also grabbed a few of the red bean Madeleines. I was actually a bit disappointed in the cheesecake. The original is MUCH better. It tasted good, but the matcha masked the taste of the cream cheese, so it felt more like eating a matcha cake, not CHEESEcake. It's worth trying if there's no line. My favourite were the red bean madeleines though. The matcha was very flavorful and the red bean filling made for a nice gooey center. I will definitely grab a couple more of those the next time I'm in the neighborhood."
1,"I've eaten here many times, and the food is always delicious and authentic Italian. Prices are reasonable (for downtown Toronto), and it has a somewhat upscale atmosphere. Don't pass up coffee and dessert!"
1,Very cheap korean food on bloor. They have very good selections of korean food. I ordered combo (rice cake and kimbab) and bibimbap and could not finish them. Very friendly staff. Recommend this place!
2,"**This review is only for the shave ice**

While my niece and I were walking up and down Kensington Market, I had mentioned that one of the things that I've always wanted to try was Hawaiian shave ice in Hawaii. We stumbled upon North Poke and it was like a mirage appeared because this shop was probably the closest thing comparable to Hawaii!

The fresh smell of fish for poke was enticing, but I was still full from an AYCE lunch earlier, boo. There were two sizes to choose from, regular and large. We opted to share a regular with two syrup choices (we chose peach and strawberry) with condensed ice. The staff used a legit ice shaving machine. You can start eating it with a spoon and use a straw to drink it afterward. There's limited seating inside the restaurant but we were able to get a window seat. It was a flavorful, light dessert that's definitely shareable. Hopefully I can go to Hawaii in the near future to try shave ice there!"
2,"If you like waiting for a long time (over a hour) for rude services, this is the perfect spot. This place is hot as it is the hype, do not go if you have a party of 4 as the wait is even longer."
2,"I was here for dinner on a Monday night, so it wasn't busy, yet the service was more than terrible. The host was miserable - I don't think she spoke to me and she definitely didn't smile. I waited for 20 minutes before asking a passing server if I could order a drink and the guy at the table next to me had been waiting longer. When she did bring my drink, she brought the one wrong, gave the guy at the next table the wrong one as well, and then didn't bother to ask my now arrived companion if she could get him a drink. It proceeded to go this way the rest of the evening - mix ups and confusion. My companion and I each had a sandwich of sorts which were only mediocre. I give this spot one star for the atmosphere and its tasty sweet potato fries. Don't go here."
1,"They have good food and provide a generous portion for the price. My favourites are fajita and the steak sandwiches. Fries are awesome too. They used to have an amazing orabge lemonade, I miss it now."
2,"Went here after two days of trying to get a table. This small hidden resto is tucked away behind a larger restaurant. The first day we were told about 1.5 to 2 hours wait. We were way too hungry so we ate elsewhere. The second night we were told 30
Minutes so we just walked around and they called us within 10 minutes. The atmosphere and facade of the place is so cool! It feels like a garage/ typical Asian street food stall. The food was amazing. My favourite was hands down the salmon. The sauce was delicious. The uni bomb was kind of a let down. The flavours didn't marinate as well together. I wouldn't order that again, but was a good try. The only down fall was that it was very cold. Because it's so small people coming in and out of from the door let the heat out and all the cold in. Other than that, it was a great experience!"
3,"Wow, it's been a while since I've done a review....

As soon as I entered, stumbling into the bar chairs that are inexplicably placed directly in front of the entrance, I felt like I was home. Well, if home was a ultra-trendy-hipster-themed restaurant with bar chairs in front of the entrance.

The atmosphere here is very relaxed (I mean, they are hipsters). It feels like I should be friends with everyone here... But, strangely, I'm feeling a bit of a cold shoulder from the staff. I might be projecting, though. There is a very \""Starbucks\"" vibe here (stole that line from another review of another resto, forget which one). 

I was here for a \""business lunch,\"" even though I was dining alone (shhhh don't tell my accountant-- wait-- I am an accountant)

I wanted to try a couple different things so I ordered rillettes (memories of France :( ) and a baby greens salad. For dessert I ordered the apparently famous burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich.

Interestingly, the rillettes alone were a bit sweet. The accompanying preserved sour cherries and pickled turnip made it even sweeter. Good thing was I still liked it. Portion was small, but then again, I was spoiled in France by having huge spoonfuls of it for supper at a friend's house... Along with the amazing Loire red it was a perfect experience. But I digress.

Actually, I don't digress-- the wine list is microscopic and at the same time too focused... A non-vintage Dolcetto D'Alba, a Spanish 2001 Tempranillo La Mancha 2001, and an Ontario Meritage 2007 is all they had for single glass reds! I peeked in their wine fridge and the selection was basically that-- Italian, Spanish and mainly Ontario. Boo.

Next up was the baby green salad with \""seasonal veggies\"" (heirloom tomatoes and cucumbers). I learned from the waitress that October is tomato season in Ontario (to clarify, the previous statement was written with extreme sarcasm). The salad was overdressed, but I like it that way-- how did they know?!?!? Greens were browning at the bottom (yuck), the hydroponic heirloom tomatoes tasted quite hydroponicky. However, the saving grace to the dish was a slight bitterness to the baby romaine, which I love, and creamy dressing and shaved sheep cheese were a perfect complement.

Finally, the burnt marshmallow ice cream sandwich. After two mini-dishes, the dessert is inexplicably gargantuan (I know I used the word \""inexplicably\"" twice. That is on purpose. I demand explanations.)  The dessert is good, but not as good as the Yelp hype, and not as good as the server sold it.

Finished off with a cappuccino that had some embarrassing latte art which I pretended not to see so that I wouldn't have to be drawn into the barista's whirlpool of shame. Actually I lied-- I didn't finish with the cap, I followed that with an espresso which was also inexplicably monstrous. I ordered a double which they somehow were able to conjure into a quadruple. 

Anyways, this is an OK place to go when you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket and are wearing your non-prescription clear Wayfarers and summer scarf with your ironic band t-shirt and espadrilles and feeling like savouring every single moment in life because really life is short and we should do more savouring shouldn't we. And on other non-such occasions as well."
2,grass jelly milk tea. There are many seats inside. Plenty of choices on the menu. Calories counts are labeled clearly. Wechat wallet and zhifubao are available.
2,"THE BEST IN TORONTO!
Coming from upstate New York-
This was the best way to end a trip to Canada. 
The BBQ at the table meat special of bulgolgi, pork belly, seafood and kalbi (we requested to exchange the chicken for kalbi, best choice ever) was more than enough for 3 hungry people. All servers were more than helpful and accommodating. All meats and seafood were seasoned to perfection! 

The owner and her son, Jason, made the dining experience unlike any other. They made my family and I feel like we were at home by conversing with us and helping us cook the BBQ in an authentic, juicy manner. Everything was spectacular and I would recommend this to any and everyone. Best Korean food and dining experience I have had in Long while."
2,Only way to go is scrolls. Their pizza is pretty good. Salads were small and not great value. I don't really understand the consistent line ups.
2,Very good bao sandwiches. Portions are good sized but not huge ... but definitely very tasty. Service was excellent. Carrot soup was also great!
2,"Their calamari would be considered their signature dish (IMO). However, the pizza are now a disappointment from yesteryear. They were once not as soggy. Their consistency of both quantity and quality has not diminished. I would prefer to see a less soggy pizza on my next visit. Perhaps I'll request it well done. Hopefully this solves the problem."
2,"Wish I could say something positive things about this place because the food is pretty good, but the service and the care they take of their guests leave much to be desired.
I have contacted them twice about my past experiences there and have yet to receive a response.
We were quoted 20 minutes at the door, but didn't realize this meant that it was 20 minutes just to get into the restaurant, not for a table.  Once inside, we waited another 45 minutes for our table, with our two kids.  
Once finally seated at our dirty table (wish I was kidding, there were still glasses left on it from the previous people), we waited 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge us, only to be told that he would be right with us. Another 10 minutes later, we actually managed to order drinks and food.  Kids' food actually came out right away, 5 minutes, ice cold, but they were hungry and it actually saved us the effort of cooling it down.  57 minutes later, our food showed up.  No apology for the wait, no acknowledgement, nothing.  Had to wait another 10 minutes for cutlery to actually eat our food because you couldn't find a server if you tried.  I had to go up the bar and ask for cutlery.  Would have loved to order another beer, or maybe some water, but once again, no one to be found.  People who got there after us were long done eating and leaving.
I wanted to ask for a manager, but once again, no one to be found and I just wanted to get out of there because the kids were acting up after our quick lunch turned into a 2.5 hour fiasco.

I wrote them twice about different things and like mentioned, have yet to hear anything back from them.
It's too bad because the food's actually really good, but the management, nor the staff seem to care about anyone.  They seemed to busy to care, or notice anything going on.  Would be a great establishment with the right person to lead them.

Won't be back and I'm making sure to tell everyone about our experience there."
2,"This place has been around for decades but has gone through a few different owner/operators.  The latest ownership change occurred over the last few months.    So we decided to check it out to see if there have been any noteworthy changes (or improvements).  

Sadly disappointed.  The place has had somewhat of a makeover.  Some new paint, new Tvs and new staff.   The menu has changed but with no great shifts in the overall patchwork approach.   Best way to describe the menu is pub meets diner  

We had crab cakes and a couple variants on the burgers.   

Meh.  

Crab cakes were quite clearly frozen.   Not a huge offence by itself but there was no heart and soul in the presentation or gArnish to make them standout.   2/10

Burgers were overcooked (burnt) and they tasted bland and almost identical despite quite different toppings.   Why bother with variants when they all taste the same?   2/10.   Fries were basic super fries but at least they cooked them as we asked (extra well done near burnt).   

Service was pleasant.  

Mixed bag of patrons detracted from the venue for us.   A few hardcore bar regulars.   A gang of ball cap wearing bieber wannabes who were loud and loaded dominated the mood.    Music was way too loud for 530pm.   


It was just weird and the food was not enough to go back for.  

Too bad.   This place was really something 25 years ago known for the best wings in Canada.    They seem to have lost their focus and are trying to be all things to all people instead of catering to a niche for the middle class families that dominate the surrounding neighbourhood.   Hope someone with vision and courage takes over in the near future and revives this local landmark.   


Good luck Grover."
2,Got bone in chicken  combo.  Was good not to hot.  Hot sause on the side to spice it up.  The doubles are thr best I've had tho awesome.   Place is new and clean.
2,"I had lunch on the patio at Joey at the Eaton Centre today with a friend.  I was not disappointed with either the service and the food.  

As in places like Earls and South of Temperance, the servers are all attractive women wearing sky-high heels and short black mini dresses.  I thought I was in a Robert Palmer video shoot when I first walked in as they were all congregating around the hostess.  Clearly, this will be a big draw for the Bay Street crowd.  

My dining companion and I shared the Ahi Tuna Taco which were fabulous.  The sushi grade tuna was perfectly cooked.  There were four little tacos which came with a delicious sauce and were nicely presented.  

I had the Sangria (delish!) and the Panang Prawn Curry Bowl (nice pesentation).  My friend had the Viva salad which he really enjoyed as well.  

Loved the vibe and decor and the open feel of the restaurant.  I also liked that the servers kept bringing finger food to the table for us to try.  

Joey is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  I will definately be back."
1,"2.5 star

Urraca Resto Lounge has been opened since July is still in growing pain. A little confused, a lot of uncertainity from the decoration, the menu and the staffs.

Is it a food place? Is it a drinking place? What's the price point? How to get the crowd in?

As a lounge, Urraca is just too bright with that huge chandelier in this relatively small space. The sofa does feel awkward, maybe I ate too much that it just sagged all the way down. 

Our waitress was definitely confused when I asked for the drink menu. No drink menu? But they can make anything for us? What's the specialities? We can make anything? $3.50 domestic beer is the only thing seems to have a pricing on!

Menu though quite interesting with a Korean fusion twist. But after all they are all deep fried bar grabs just dressed up with Korean ingredients. We shared

Bulgogi Poutine ($7)
- good as snack with generous portion

Kimchi Rice Ball ($7)
- the better dish of the night, crispy outside and mushy inside and quite delicious too
- huge portion!! 

Roast Pork Belly ($10)
- the pork belly were so deep fried that they were rubbery and dry
- roast vs deep fried? maybe they should change the description or just take that off the menu

Urraca does have a lot of potential to be a good place to eat and hang out with friends. Price is good with generous serving. But management really need to step up and at least dim the light, have a drink menu put together and maybe get some beers on draft?!"
1,"This place is surprisingly not that bad.

Their BBQ pork with veggies combo is pretty good in my opinion.  When the lady asks if you want BBQ sauce on your pork, definitely accept, it is delicious!  It comes in at just around $5 and is more than enough food to fill you up for lunch.

Unlike many of the other restaurants in the food court, they have good value regardless of if you are a student or not, which is a nice touch.

Really nothing mind blowing here, but if you aren't sure which place to go to when at this food court and you enjoy Chinese then this place is a decent option.  It is also really cheap, in case your wallet took a big hit from last night's bar hopping."
3,"I didn't HATE the place! Hate is a strong word but I wouldn't come back again for its food! My friend says that people come at night and drink. I came here during the middle of the afternoon and I didn't enjoy my experience here. 

Food: They had a lot of asian fusion. I for one, despise Asian fusion cuisine! It's just weird... if i want Asian food, I would get asian food. Unless I have no other alternative... 

I ordered a burger there and it tasted OK. Not something i would pay that much for again. The prices weren't high but taking the taste into consideration, i wouldn't pay over $10 for an OK burger and fries. The french fries weren't that great... I had to force myself to eat it; just so i didn't waste food. 

Service: VERY SLOW. The place was almost empty during the middle of the day but the services wasn't very good. The waiter was slightly stuck-up! He wasn't very friendly but he wasn't rude. He seemed unhappy to be there and serving us. 

The atmosphere: The place looked old like it needs to be renovated. IDK if that's intentional or not."
1,"Have you ever been blown away by a broth-based foodstuff? I almost walked past the narrow storefront, but you can't miss the lunch-hour line-up snaking out the door. For $11 bucks you get soup 'n' a wrap; perhaps a comfort to those not sated by soup alone. 

While most people do takeout, we snagged a spot on the back patio (which is bigger than the entire restaurant). My meal came out on a lazy susan (for some reason) and I dove in with vehemence.  The lamb curry wrap was an amazing blend of flavours, and a corn chowder literally made me weep (not literally). It was amazing. Go there, eat soup.  Do not delay.

Obligatory Title Pun: These soups are RAVI-shing.

Menu Readability: Where to start? Everywhere you look are menu items manically brushed in Gerald Scarfe-ian printing.  (Think \""Fear and Loathing\"" less the bats.) 

Need to mention: A communal table divides the restaurant that appears to be a cross-section slab of an enormous tree.

What this place teaches me about myself: It took everything in me not to sing the \""Soup Crimp\"" while in here.

1,"The reviews don't lie, such a great Banh Mi, really affordable as well. Only docking it a star cause the place is so small there was nowhere to sit so I had to eat it outside. Get the Pork Belly one!"
2,Looking for wings in Cabbagetown? This is a decent place. Clean. Very nice owner. Decent specials. Fully recommended.
1,"Well after my first experience here was not the Best, I certainly wanted to give it another try....I met my friend James here for lunch today.........and oh my it was worth the wait ! 

The food was fantastic. I had the cheese sandwich and James had the pork, we both had the chowder......well the soup was wonderful and the portion size was just perfect for lunch.
 
My sandwich was great - didn't realize it was going to be a hot sandwich - grilled cheese, so when the warm sandwich with homemade ketchup arrived it was a pleasant surprise, and not enough ketchup.....but it  was just wonderful !  

James loved his sandwich with the exception of the sunny side up egg on top...he didn't know it would arrive like that. 

The specials and the square peg that were described for the day sounded just incredible.......

$30 + $5 tip was a pretty good deal for lunch.

I do have to mention that the service was very slow...out of 10 - service was around a 4. After we received our meal, he was not attentive at all......don't think that will stop me from returning as I'm sure I will be back !"
1,"I come here for the lunch specials regularly. At $10-12 for pasta, sandwiches or meals that come with soups or salads it's very reasonably priced. The decor is lovely and it has a more casual feel to it than other italian places in this neck of the woods. The tiramisu is to DIE FOR! I wish the bread served in the restaurant was warmer, and came with butter that wasn't rock hard. Fresh baked bread with butters, oils and vinegars is just such a staple."
2,Stopped in after elmwood spa today for a girls day and grabbed some lunch.  Cute little sandwich place with friendly staff.  Ordered the TLP and it was great.  You can add your own condiments as well.  Would return if in the area again for sure!
2,"Went there on a Friday night with some friends. They have a good number of tables and the place is fairly good size. Tried 3 different desserts amongst us all, I really liked the brick toast  which was basically a 2\"" thick slice of egg bread with condensed milk and whipped cream and milk. Fantastic. Also tried the blueberry cheese cake and la roca chocolate cake. Slices were good size and for the price was pretty standard compared to other places. The brick toast though was definitely better than other places and would Def try again. The service was pretty good. The ladies behind the counter were very nice and welcoming."
2,"I have been to La Carnita a few times now and finally decided that it's time to contribute a review. 

Expect to wait a while before you get a table. Every time I've come here, we started with a few drinks at the bar. Because the line up is so long, we usually down about five drinks more than we expect and give in and just have dinner at the bar. This is a plus as the bartenders are pretty good. 

Speaking of drinks, they have a good selection of the usual hipster craft beers as well as OE in a paper bag. It goes down well with the 90s hip hop. 

The tacos do not disappoint. I've tried most of them. Three is usually enough for someone with an appetite. I recommend the fish one, but it's not like you'll be upset with the others. The corn was pretty good, but don't order it if you're on a date or else you'll be surreptitiously trying to remove corn from your teeth for the remainder of the date. 

Finish dinner off with a few more drinks. By then you're probably drunk. That's when you need to order the Churros. I can probably eat 10 of those. And then drink whatever they're dipped in."
2,"Love this cute place. Came here for lunch and we had the Ahi Tuna Sandwich with double seaweed salad ( you get 2 sides) and the Crispy Haddock with crispy potatoes and slaw.

Both were cooked perfectly, especially the Crispy Haddock.
Service was very fast. Great fresh food even when you have a short lunch!!!"
2,"Place was garbage. Long lines that are not worth the wait. Spend time in another busy Toronto line rather than this place. Crowded bar, weak serving skills, overly power hungry security, and nothing special about the set up. Saw a group behind us not be allowed in because they had beer in line at the back of the line when they weren't even in front of the bar. Security made them do the whole line to then tell them they are not allowed in. When they tried to reason with the dumb bouncer he only made it worse. Joke of a place."
3,"I ate at Pappa's with a few friends during Taste of the Danforth and it was great, especially given the high volume of customers this past weekend. The tirokefteri dip was incredible - very spicy and flavourful. 3 guests had the chicken souvlaki dinner, and the chicken was moist and tender, with generous portions of potatoes, rice and greek salad. I ordered the 'Garithes Me Feta' and was only disappointed at the fact that there wasn't more of it. At $13 for an appetizer, I hoped to receive more than 4 pieces of shrimp, but the flavours of the roasted tomatoes and onions were great!! The baklava dessert was a generous portion, and delicious. 
The service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected given that it's probably the busiest weekend of the year. Our server, Matthew, was attentive and provided excellent recommendations. 
I will definitely be returning!!"
2,"Went on 3pm on a Saturday and there was no wait. This has been the best place I've had pho in Toronto. I had the bun rieu and the fiancé had bun bo hue. We also tried the papaya salad which was also very good. Would I wait in line for this place? No. Would I come again? Yes. 
Staff were pretty friendly as well!!"
2,"This place would have gotten a 5 star rating had the service been faster.

What I can say is that the food speaks for itself at this place.

I's recommend the Tuna Tartar (If you are feeling adventurous) as well as the vegetable Udon Soup (Amazing Broth!)

My wife and I went for our anniversary and I'm happy to report that we had a great time at Yuzu No Hana, The decor was great and the food was fantastic and fresh."
2,"Not what you expect from a typical diner- the food is exceptional with attention to detail. Beautiful presentation and great service. Wait times are long (45min on a Saturday at noon) but well worth it. Small, cozy, and beautiful touches with art and marble tabletops. Instagrammers haven!

Ordered the Shroom's on toast with a side of hashbrowns- you'll want to order both! Packed with flavour, there's no skimping on ingredients here.

They also employ women from the local YWMCA and play the best hits from the 90's- what's not to love?

Note- while waiting for your table head on over to Hailed Coffee for a delicious latte or cappuccino"
2,"Sorry to say it, but don't waste your time with this place. Everything was overcooked and bland. Nothing tasted fresh and I was overall disappointed."
2,"Kibo is one of my favourite places on St. Clair! The sushi quality is good. The miso soup is the best ! If you have friends going with you, I recommend the love boats as long as you all can eat sashimi and sushi. The service is always 100% and they are super nice. 

The bento boxes are also a great size is every you weren't craving sushi. Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for a sushi spot near St. Clair and Bathurst"
3,"Had lunch here a little over a week ago with a group of colleagues.  We made a reservation for the patio and I am happy we did.

We arrived on time and were seated right away.  There were 8 of us in total and the service was really speedy considering the size of the group.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable, very friendly and accommodating.  

We ordered the crab cakes, the Caesar salad, crispy chicken, fish and chips and a host of other dishes.  The crab cakes, fish and chips and the crispy chicken proved to be favourites among the group.  I can't honestly remember what every one ordered, but those who ordered these dishes raved about them the most (including me, as I had the crab cakes and the crispy chicken).  The crab cake was extremely flavourful and perfectly cook.  The chicken was a little dry, but the coating on the chicken was very tasty and quite aromatic.  My colleague across from me had the fish and chips and she said it was good.  The French fries that came with the fish and chips were really good too.

Their wine list is quite extensive and reasonably priced.  They also had freshly made juices and tho I didn't have any, those who did raved about them.

The patio is quite nice, with ample seating and a lot of tropical plants surrounding the perimeter of the patio.  It's a great lunch spot for the patio alone.  From what I understand, the patio is used by Far Niente during lunch and Four uses It in the evenings.

After lunch, it had started to rain so we made our way inside for dessert, which was by far, the most disappointing part of the meal.  The creme brulee was average at best, the chocolate layer cake tasted like it was fresh out of the freezer, and the gelato tasted like chocolate soft serve ice cream.  I guess this place has built it's reputation on its entrees, not its desserts, which is unfortunate.  The coffee we had with dessert was quite good though.

Our server brought us our bill  -18% gratuity had been added automatically given that we were a group of 8, which I didn't mind since it saved me the trouble of figuring it out myself.

This is a good spot for lunch/dinner if you're paying with a corporate card, as the ambiance lends itself well to business lunches/dinners, but I wouldn't want to come here on a date, the food is good, but the feel is definitely corporate."
2,"Last Friday came for dinner for my boyfriend 's birthday at Dragon Pearl at York Mills. It was my first time eating at Dragon Pearl. We had 25 people gathering in the VIP private room, which is fancy. There are two big tall chairs at each table. The staff there were very responsible and not only they gave him a free meal, but also offered him one heart-shape birthday cake and sang songs together as well which was a nice surprise! It wasn't very crowded and the ambiance was nice. I noticed there was always staff around leading people to their tables, cleaning up tables quickly, always attentive, my glass of water was never empty and our dishes were cleared almost instantly. All in all our experience here was great! Thank you for the kind service and hospitality!"
2,"Snarky server that was super disinterested and wouldn't look at us when we were ordering set the tone for my most recent visit. Sorry for being a bother, I guess. 

Food wise, this is nothing like it was when I made my first review. I've eaten here three times recently and each time everything was a missed opportunity. Ribwhich, bangers and mash, shroomie doom dooms, popcorn tofu, butter chicken burrito, Coleslaw, rib dinner; all lacking flavour, all remarkably tasteless.

Sad times. Food so bland I felt the need to update my review."
2,"Oh for the love of god.  I somehow ended back up here again to have some drinks with some friends and unfortunately had to use their bathroom.  Again, 3 months later, water leaking out of the ceiling in the women's bathroom into a plastic tray that was filled with unsightly yellowy water.  And, while I was washing my hands, some water dripped from the ceiling out of a bubble, on to my head.  SHUDDER!!!  I'm worried that the entire floor is going to collapse from rot.  

And this time around, staff were not very friendly.  What's going on here?"
2,"I am a Fish n Chip connoisseur (from NZ & AUS) & this place is AMAZING! I had the $10 lunch special, sandwich, pickle & fries & was super happy. The fish is FRESH which really makes a difference. Nth America does not have what I call 'proper chips' (thick cut, local potatoes) but this place is definitely the best I've had in Toronto. Great job, keep it up. Support these guys!! I will be back"
1,Friendly staff. Delicious ingredients. One price for pizza and any number of toppings. Bottomless soft drinks. Nice decor. Free WiFi.  Work gang loved it. Will be one of our new goto lunch spots.
1,This was my first dim sum experience and overall it was an enjoyable one! Although I don't have much to benchmark the experience against I thought the food was good but didn't overly impress me. Restaurant was quite large and loud - as expected for a dim sum restaurant especially at this price point. Price was reasonable with 5 items and tea coming to around $25. I'm not going to pretend I know exactly what I ate - my girlfriend ordered everything!
2,"After eating the yummiest gyro in the land of gyros- Greece (in oblix restaurant in Santorini), we had been craving really good gyros for a long time. So we planned to stop her for lunch on our way to Toronto. The gyros were served as in oblix with fries, yummy tzatziki and without lettuce but i think the bread could have been better... Perhaps fresher. I'd go there again."
2,"The Rudy Burger is the closest thing to a Shake Burger from Shake Shack that I've been able to find in Canada. I just can't get enough. Best burger in TO (and these are bold words coming from a longtime Burger's Priest fan).

The deep-fried pickles are also delicious. Poutine is hit or miss (sometimes it's melted mozzarella instead of cheese curds). But if I wanted a killer poutine I'd go elsewhere!"
2,"mmmmm soups... 

It's not often you get to slurp good soup to your heart's content and still have some leftover in the bowl (why is soup always served in such negligible portions?). Here at Ravi Soups, you get a nice big bowl of gourmet flavours like curried lentil and apricot, roasted corn etc. etc. The soup really takes the cake. 

But then, you go on and make a stoopid mistake like ordering a wrap. And in the sharpest contrast ever, get served what should be hospital food: soggy white wrap, boiled chicken and unmemorable filings. In one word: Sapless.

Reader Poll: Have YOU ever dipped your wrap in your soup?"
2,"Food is amazing! Have to deduct one star, for not having an accessible washroom on the same level as the restaurant. Washrooms down steep set of stairs. Awkward for those who have mobility issues."
1,"I had dinner here the food was amazing and the service was so nice.  I would definitely go again.

The prices for a really nice night out are very reasonable for a three course meal.  Its very small and simple, but the foods is delicious."
1,All hail poutine! Portions are huge and served with care. Embarrassed to say I ate a portion and a half. Friggin' worth it!
2,"The jambalaya is a meal on its own and well worth the adventure!  Good food, good service and general ambience.

But gosh, the parking is fun!  The closest lot featured an automated machine that claimed to work but didn't give a receipt so who knows?  (BTW, it didn't appear on the monthly statement but it did keep the money of the next guyI warned him!)  

Not wanting to have to recover a towed vehicle and spoil the evening, I moved to another lot ... it took my money and gave me a receipt ... that was blank!  I put it on the dash and took a chance.  It was worth it!

It`s all been said before; accessible."
2,"I'm still thinking about those Red Velvet Pancakes. We arrived on a Saturday morning at 9:10 AM, and the main floor was already full of seated guests. We were seated by 9:25 AM, in the upstairs seating area, which was bright, clean, with huge windows, and spacious. By the time we left at 10:30 AM, there was a line of people waiting for tables. Make sure you come early, or you'll be waiting!

First, parking. We found free street parking just a block east on Armadale Ave (a less than 2 minute walk to the restaurant). 

Second, the food. We ordered: a) a coffee (free refills), b) a tea (oolong), c) red velvet pancakes, d) a side of bacon (because, obviously), and e) huevos rancheros. Overall, a hearty, delicious meal. The huevos rancheros were average to decent - imagine gigantic nacho chips topped with minimal guacamole, and salsa, for $14. It definitely needed more guac (for the price, anyway). But... the red velvet pancakes made up for it. Fluffy, light, with the fresh scents of cocoa wafting through your nostrils, it was heavenly. We were expecting overtly sweet, dense pancakes after seeing pictures, but it was absolutely perfect. Wonderful, light, moist texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Combined with a side of crispy, fresh bacon, it was the perfect way to start off a Saturday. 

Lastly, service was wonderful and attentive. Thanks to Calla for making our first time at their restaurant a great one, and for excellent service!

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid $48.00."
1,"Quite a stroll from me, but well worth it!  I look forward to going back.
Very bright, open space.  The decor is trendy and simple.  There is lots of seating, but it never feels claustrophobic or too close for comfort with the people beside you.  The coffee and pastries were delicious and fairly priced.
The area and the shop had a layed back vibe which was great!  Count me in!"
2,"This location is still open but shouldn't be. It's terrible service. I've waited up to 30 minutes for TAKE OUT. I've been given dried hard rice and beans before. The strips are the size of half a strip for other locations. Fries are dry--I've even seen fresh fried fries be dropped out of the fryer in a brick to be broken up. Speaking of--you get the smallest pinch of fries with your combo, about half the amount of a normal serving. 

Skinny guy that works cash is an asshole--very condescending. No one cleans up the place. There's been times a whole entire section of tables was full of bits of food and trays with bones and cups. Take out or dine in, had to always ask for napkins or a spork. No napkins available to just take when needed.

This location was basically the relocation of the Yonge and Wellesley location before it got shut down for condo development. But it's an absolute dump. You're better off walking to the one at Yonge and Dundas or even better, the one near Yonge and Isabella."
2,"it's good overall, the chicken is just  touch in the dry side. The customer service is non existent sadly ."
2,I was so disappointed with this place. What a yukki food. I have chicken vandaloo and I had a light food poising after that. It's a first time in a long long time. Starters were so so. We had calamari and nachos which were not bad. I was with my friends and some of them had a burger and some other chicken. Fries which came with it were overcooked. Burger was so so because my friends didn't finish it. But the place itself looked very nice and our waitress was great. Very disappointed with food though.
2,"This place is not even fair! Do you know when you bite into something and you don't even know how that item exists in your life and how you don't know how often you need to come there but you need it every day?!!! That is how I feel about their matcha brownies! 
They make the brownies in house! Be warned that they contain walnuts for anyone who is allergic! 

Matcha ice cream is a goooooooooo as well as their cheesecake! But seriously if you go to Konjiki Ramen (they share the space) get yourself a damnnnnn brownie!!! Oh wait don't because then they'll sell out before I can get more"
2,The food here is pretty good. But the portions are really small and the service was terrible. There was a manager/owner and employee behind the counter. The employee just did not seem happy to be there. Was pissed off the whole time he was taking and preparing the order. Unimpressed with the overall experience. Waste of prime Toronto real estate
2,"This place is terrible. We came in around 6:30 on a Wednesday night.  We ordered the bison burger, salmon burger, bannock taco and a pickerel dish between the four of us. The server kept forgetting the settings and our orders.  He gave us popcorn as an appy that he grabbed with his hands from the big bowl in the kitchen.  The bison burger patty was not cooked through being quite red.  Ground meat needs to be cooked through!  Obviously the patty was frozen and was just seared.  The salmon was dry. The taco was covered with a tepid, ill-tasting sauce that I suspect was from a can.  The pickerel was pan-fried and was as dry as the salmon. Mashed potatoes for the pickerel were cold.  The coleslaw was sloppy and very watery.   My wife got the wrong tea drink.   To top it off were given the wrong bill. There was only one other group there besides us.  I cannot recommend this restaurant at all."
2,Everything from the food to music is dope here. Totally recommend it for anytime of the day. Great place.
3,"My wife and I were going to go elsewhere for date night (our girls with the sitter) but I really wanted to try the new restaurant on the block. Pretty disappointing all round. It was VERY busy & since we didn't have a reservation they placed us at the upper bar for all of 30 seconds (bartender was not friendly) then more confusion when the front of house were confused where to place us for a second time... 
My wife ordered the fish & chips - not great.
Sort of wet mushy sole on the inside and crispy on the outside. Nothing light and fresh about it. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious !
I think the owners have a real shot at making something happen here long term BUT the worst part of our experience wasn't necessarily the food but the service all round. Our waitress was not great. After our appetizers  she asked \""so would you like anything more or?\"" Excuse me ? We've ordered $10 beers and 2 appies - we're out on Friday night - what do you think?
Bad Service. And to top it off she neglected us the whole night - aside from taking our initial order we had about 3 different people come to our table . Bad service. We have to tip 15 or 20% to a waitress we never see?
Everyone else did her work for her !
If this is the owners idea of expediting food & drink efficiently - this is the incorrect way to serve your customers - go back to genuine - 1 server service - to pay $100+ and be treated like that is horrible. Your hardworking paying customers deserve much better attention. Not a good first date out for us in over 9 months. ! Not sure if we'll go back ..."
2,"Relying on Yelp, I picked this place., However, all we got was poor experience. Service in generally slow, food was over rated. Very disappointed ."
2,"Best pie in Toronto, potentially the world. I can't get enough of the strawberry rhubarb and strawberry cream, simply fabulous. Every person I've introduced their pies too instantly falls in love. Add on Tim's great service and the vintage decor....what is their not to love!!!!"
1,"The food & selection (4/5): They offer a wide variety of choices, ranging from meat to seafood. The portions are perfect too. You can also choose to do all boiled, deep fried or half/half for your perogies. However, there is only one vegetarian option and two dessert choices. Also don't have a high expection of their alcoholic drinks. 
    
-Smoking Pig Roast  (half/half): A little too salty, esp the chorizo. I like the deep fried perogies over the boiled ones. 
-BBQ Philly Cheese Steak (deep fried): The beef was very tendered and cheese wasn't overpowering. It's a good combination with the deep fried perogies.
-Strawberry and Chocolate (dessert): The sweet perogies are deep fried, wrapped with ricotta cheese. Not overly sweet but quite heavy after eating just one or two (esp after the savory dish). Very interesting flavors, but not a big fan of sweet perogies I'd say (I always claimed there's no dessert I don't like, but this might be the first; but then again it's just personal preference). 

Cost (4/5): Got a Groupon deal which I ended up paying only $27 plus tax and tips (which added up to around $15) for dinner for two, including two pierogie dishes, 2 alcoholic drinks under $10 and a dessert to share..however, without the Groupon,  you would expect to pay $70 + tax for what I got.

Service (3.5/5): Staffs were quite attentive. Food took longer to come than expected, but it was okay as we weren't in a rush. For one of the drinks we got though, they took it away right before we even tried it, since they said they made a mistake / forgot to lemon juice in it and had to remake it. 

Ambience (4/5): They put their menu on a massive chalkboard and the rest of the decor is nice and simple which makes the restaurant pretty neat and comfortable. They also have nice and roomy booths for 2 (up to 4) people so it was a great place to eat in."
2,"Smelled of mold. 

Walked in on a first date. Place came highly recommended. Unfortunately it stunk of mildew or mold. Will not be going back."
1,"$5 cover charge gets you in the door where you can play all the retro games for as long as you want, but remember not to hog the games. There is not obligations to make any minimum purchase, but I found the food menu (although limited) was reasonably priced. I got some nachos, but it was stale, so I would not recommend. They also have a nice beer selection and prices are typical bar prices. 

Overall, it's a great place to hangout with friends and have corporate events and if you ever feel like reminesing about the good'ol days :)"
3,"The only good thing about this restaurant is that you can skip the longest line to get to the top of the CN tower. But actual restaurant is nothing worthy of the money spent here. 

Its unfortunate that chefs are absolutely not creative, I only tasted my main dish and could not even imagine to have another bite. If you think that getting pre-fix menu would be savings - don't. 

If I am to rate the food - its 1 STAR
If I am to rate service - 2 STARS 
If I am to rate the place - they do offer fantastic views so here you go 5 STARS

If you are there just to cut the line to the observation deck - opt out for the one main course. 

My feeling about this place is that they dont' even try..... plenty of tourists to get by.... very sad..."
2,"Went for winterlicous, the menu was delicous, especially the meat reductions they use. I've had duck confit in Paris, and this one is comparable. The raspberry ice cream dessert was rich and creamy, one of the best I had.

Service was top notch: polite, warm and welcoming staff. I loved the family atmosphere of this restaurant, which seems rare for those with high end French cuisine."
3,"Not the greatest ramen restaurant that I've been to. 

Positives: 
Generous portions including the amount of noodles and garnish. 
The noodles were by far one of the best I've had; perfect texture.
Cosy and clean atmosphere. If you're coming with a large group though, you may not end up sitting all together because it is a smaller restaurant. We didn't make reservations though. We were 8 people. 
The pork in the shio ramen I ordered was amazing, very flavourful. 
Friendly and welcoming staff. 
Comfortable atmosphere. 

Things to improve on: 
The broth for the shio ramen that I ordered was not very tasty at all. It had a strange almost fishy taste. I usually go for shio ramen whenever I order ramen, and this time it just wasn't good. The broth also overpowered most of the garnish that was in there except for maybe the pork and the arugula. The chicken that it came with tasted like it was pre frozen and barely had flavour. 
For ramen that was just mediocre, it was quite expensive. The shio ramen I ordered was one of the cheaper ramen bowls which was $10.50. I think you can get something better for your money at Touhenboku Ramen on Queen Street. 

Not sure if I would come back here or not. Some of the bowls my friends ordered looked much better than mine such as the Tan Tan Men. They were also quite happy with that choice."
2,"I absolutely LOVE this place and have been attending for years, introducing my friends and family from out of town, always showing my love, appreciation, and support. I've loved how accommodating, enthusiastic, and homey this place is, as are their employees. However, this morning was a curveball I would've never expected.

I just had possibly the worst interaction I've ever had over the phone with one of their staff members in regards to a potential visit. I would never speak to someone like that, nor would I ever dismiss a potential customers' questions or visits. This person was very cold over the phone, did not answer my questions, and hung up on me. How completely rude and uncalled for. Is this how they treat their clientele? Am I just blind to it because the food is so delicious?

Regardless of such deliciousness, I really don't think I'll be bringing myself to this place any time soon, nor introducing anyone again if such attitude persists. Thanks, but no thanks!"
2,"Hang on... This place is called Aris Grill, while there's a place just down Roncesvalles called Aris Place... coincidence? Nope.

Aris Athanaselos, whose family runs Aris Place, retired a few years ago, but apparently couldn't sit still and wanted to get back into the diner biz. The scuttlebutt is that they wouldn't let him back into Aris Place, so he started a similar (but subtly different) operation up the street.

Aris Grill is brighter and more cheerful than its decades-old predecessor, and focuses more on the breakfast/brunch trade, and also makes specialty sandwiches. They don't do big dinners here like they do at the other Aris, but their breakfast specials are on longer."
2,"Dinner at Barque was awesome. We shared the platter with Beef ribs, brisket and sausage. Caesar salad, potatoes and Cuban corn for sides. Although we got ribs, the corn was easily the messiest thing to eat (although delicious). The spiced butter was generously lathered on the cob ensuring every kernel was covered and no napkins would be wasted.

I don't think I'd get the ribs again, as they weren't that good. Kind of chewy, and not a ton of meat on there. And they used way too much rosemary in the rub, which overpowered everything else in there.

But, that brisket was top notch. Sometimes brisket is dry or bland. This was perfect brisket. Highly recommended."
2,"The term \""Konjiki\"" means gold in Japanese. On the logo, there is a bird. I have no doubt that with the quality, attitude and calibre of the chefs. This ramen venue will shine and fly like a bird. 

I was very lucky to have the opportunity to attend the media tasting and even more lucky to have the opportunity to interview Chef Atsushi Yamamoto.

The ramen was made from scratch with multiple trial and error to determine the right amount of flour from japan and local flour. Every detail was thought out, from the container to store the ramen was shipped from Japan to ensure the moist level keeping the quality consistent. The texture of the noodle was chewy and bounces in your mouth. It was just right, it's almost like perfect al dente but in ramen style.

The broth was not greasy, clear and very flavourful. As Chef Atsushi Yamamoto only source the freshest ingredients. He selected Toronto to open his ramen stand due to the accessibility of the variety of fresh ingredients and cater to the local customer's flavour. By adding shaved truffles, cherry stone clams, or lobster to the different broth. He is using these special ingredient as a way to connect to the local culture and taste. Bringing ramen to the next level, to transform the concept of ramen from something fast to fill the stomach, to a refined and gourmet appreciation. 

That's why when I asked him, since this first store is located in the Yonge and Shepard area, will it be open late for the late owl foodies. His response was only to 10:00pm or 11:00pm as he wants to maintain the quality and good ingredients takes time to prepare. Hence, his day to prep starts as early as 5:00am in the morning. 

At the front end of the store, there will be a dessert  component called SARYO. You will have the full selection of desserts there while at Konjiki there will be selected desserts such as Uji Matcha Rare cheesecake with Anko (red bean) 

Chef Atsushi Yamamoto sets very high standard, from the size of the eggs, (very nicely marinated, the best that I have had so far) to meticulously roasting the corn, or bamboo shoot to bring out each layer of flavours into the bowl of ramen. 

Highly recommend this venue. I've enjoyed the ramen so much that I can eat the noodle on its own! Stay tune for the grand opening and try a bowl of ramen done with passion and creativity."
2,"L O C A T I O N 
In North York on the corner of Yonge St and Holmes Ave. It's the big brown door on the corner. They have quite a bit of street parking. Came in on a Friday night and the waiting area is small, no chairs, and you'll feel the gust of wind when someone opens the door.

//Potato Cream Curry Udon// ($13) OH-EM-GEE This was absolutely delicious!! Who ever thought mash potato on udon was a good idea is seriously a genius. I had my hesitations on this, but am so glad I got it. It was creamy, noodle-ly, and it had a nice mellow curry heat to it. After finishing the udon I drank the potato soup because it was just THAT good (don't judge me).
//Black Sesame Puree Udon w/ Beef// ($15) This too was mouth-watering-ly yummy. It had a strong nutty savory flavor that balances out the potato cream udon. 
//Oven Baked Udon// ($15) This dish was good too, but I might have gotten more than I can chew. I feel like I can make this at home since it has Tex-Mex cheese and bacon bits. It was cheesy and still delicious but the first two dishes blew my mind. 
//Hickory Smoked Old Fashioned// ($15) Wish I sat in the bar when bartender made this because it looked cool from far away. He burned a little bit of hickory and trapped it inside a glass dome with the drink inside. The drink had a good balance of whiskey to ice.
S E R V I C E 
Since we came during peak time service was understandably slow. We had to wait about 45 minutes till a table was ready. At one point we saw some patrons leaving early because the food came out too slow so they had their food on takeout boxes instead. When we finally got seated our waitress was very pleasant and let us know in advance that the kitchen was backed-up. You can tell that the servers were stretched thin because they've been working/walking non-stop. Had to flag down the waitress or whoever to help us with our meal/cashing out. Still they provided pleasant service.
O V E R A L L
Came here solely because I saw a video of Insider Food about this place. Their delicious Potato Udon and Black Sesame Beef Udon were to die for! Even though the wait for seating was long, the food made up for it. Service was good considering it was a busy weekend night. Will return...with empty bellies next time."
2,"One of my favorite bars in Toronto! Great beer and cocktail selection, as well as great service! Be prepared to stand because this place is always busy!"
1,"I've been to Hogtown a few times, most recently for Saturday brunch with 2 friends. It's conveniently located a couple blocks east of Dufferin Station.

We got the 5 pc wings in BBQ sauce ($9), they taste like boneless chicken tenders *drool*. The Fried French Toast Sliders ($12) were 2 mini french toast sandwiches stacked high with PB, banana, and tofu bacon - very good. The un-Chicken and Waffles ($14) never fails to disappoint and is my go-to for brunch there - but beware: order this with a size of homefries and you will have a HUGE portion on your hands. The Tofu Rancheros ($13) is also a generous portion if you want a more colourful/healthy option for brunch. All the mains we ordered came with a side of homefries or chef salad. 

Service is super friendly and the interior is cozy. Prepare to wait a bit for a table if you come during a rush hour period - it's worth it. And if you're like me and aren't a huge fan of dressing, you might want to order it on the side because they are heavy handed with dressing on their chef salad.

Definitely come here if you want a huge choice of vegan comfort food options and generous portions - this place never fails to impress."
3,"I went in here after going to Nak Won for dinner. We walked up the stairs and the decor was pretty cute. It was like princess peach on acid in victorian times. I liked it.

We sat down on the two person table in the mad corner, and the waitress brought us the menu.

The menu was really cute, it had a really cute type face and some of the specialty items had really cutesy names. 

Too bad it was too expensive for us to stay. 

Maybe closer to payday, ill try again."
1,"Visited with my friend and his mom on a Monday. They have a weekly special of a variety of things, I got the sliced beef with rice teppanyaki and it was alright. I would have liked more meat, but the sauce they make u pour into the sizzling plate was good. I would've liked a better bowl to have poured the sauce with because they gave me a regular bowl and it got messy because there was no spout. Other than that, my meal was alright, on the better side. I would give it a 3.5 if I could. We also ordered the Oreo brick toast tower for $14 something and wow was it big. I would suggest sharing it between 4 people because it's a lot. Totally recommended! You get a lot for your money. It was also very delicious. They have a wide selection of desserts too which I will definitely have to come back and check out"
1,"Damn good. As everyone says, there's extremely limited seating and it's busy, even on a cold, rainy day. Regardless, the wait was short and all the employees were sweet! The atmosphere was cheerful and alive. 

Ordered the Baja fish taco, carnitas and chicken. Didn't get a chance to take a picture bc I was so busy scarfing it down. The Baja fish was by far the best (and messiest-I ended up eating it w a fork. Help yourself to the wet naps they've set out for sure!), but they were all taaaasty. I guess $6 is a lot for one taco, but they are REALLY stuffed, which is what I was before I had even finished two. I'll be back for sure."
2,"If you want the best Greek food in the GTA I would recommend coming here. I always get the chicken souvlaki dinner, it comes with a nice large portion Greek salad, 3/4 of a whole potato, a bit more then 2 cups of cooked rice and a whole chicken skewer. The meat is always beautifully cooked with the right amount of spices, I love the first bite since it always has this nice spice kick (not heat spice but flavour spices). Now the salad is my favourite, it's always covered in feta and a nice light dressing. The potatoes and rice are a nice tasty mouth filler while you take a small piece of chicken and dip it in the tzatziki. Just a great place for great food.

That being said, if you want good service, a nice dining room, a place to take your kids then don't come here, you need to be firm with the staff and just go up and ask them for what you want. The food is too good to miss here!"
3,"I've been here twice and have tried the Shokai set menu, Miku set menu, and the Coal Harbour Platter.

My favourite dish is probably the 1st course of the Miku meal - everything was so fresh and well seasoned! The raw prawns just melted in my mouth, and the oysters were flavoured incredibly (didn't taste like salt water). Everything that followed was good (the sushi stood out the most), but we kept thinking of the seafood and had to order more before dessert came. 

So, we ordered the large Coal Harbour Platter. Overall I don't think I'll order the platter again - maybe it's because I ate it in the middle of the 5 course meal, but I found some of the flavours confusing, and comparatively speaking, it's not even close to being their strongest dish. We did manage to finish the platter, despite the large portions of everything, and we moved on to dessert, which was excellent! I loved every item on the plate. 

Their cocktails are delish. At $15, they are pricey for sure, but for me the drinks really rounded out the experience.

Overall, spacious and modern ambience, friendly service, and great food (that is well portioned). I would recommend giving this place a try, and I will definitely be back."
2,"Delicious wraps and sandwich combos! Amazingly fresh taste. They've got their sauces down. The texture of the wrap is thin but crispy. 

Curried lamb is my favourite wrap, chicken is average (good quality chicken but too much yam), the pork shoulder is very filling and a bit dry but that can be fixed with their delicious sauce as a side on the plate.

The mushroom soup is my favourite. Clam chowder with crab was very good too, you can really taste the cran. Ravi stew is alright, it's on the spicy side. 

There is a backyard patio which is nice during the warmer months. It's a little dead during dinner time but the quality of food is just as great.

I wish they would keep updating or change up their menus!"
3,"If you want to potentially get food poisoning, then I suggest you check Ajisen out.

If you desire your fried chicken (karaage) to be raw and pink in the middle, then eat at this restaurant.

To call this place a ramen house, is disgraceful to the Japanese/ Korean art of Ramen.

The service as lacklustre and the chicken dish my husband and I shared made us immediately sick.

I suggest when you see the statue of the winking Asian girl with the gigantic bowl of ramen mounted outside of Ajisen Ramen, that you keep on walking... there is deceit in that wink... and your tummy and wallet will thank you later."
2,"The last stop of a citywide bar crawl was at Reposado Bar & Lounge.

I came here for an Elite Event a couple of summers ago, liked it then and like it now!
Great location; if you're jonesing to change scenes, you have other bars to choose from as Queen Street is 2 blocks away. The drink menu is quite diverse with beers and various cocktails. I had the Mango Margarita, which was delicious. The jazz band was fantastic. Reposado is overall a very chill place where you can enjoy great music and fantastic drinks.

I'm a fan !"
1,"Came here for lunch on a Fri around 1:30pm.
Restaurant was about 40% full.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I got the beef teriyaki lunch special.  It came in a bento box with miso soup, salad, spring roll and a few pieces of fried fish for $10.  Was good tasting all the different items in the bento box.  The beef was more over cooked than I liked and wasn't  much beef either.  Overall portion size of the bento box was good.  They also offer barley tea for free.  Would be interested in coming back to try different dish."
2,"Big love for Big Daddy's Bourbon Street Bistro & Oyster Bar. Creole fish and chips was average tasting but there's big love for the popcorn shrimp, jalapeño cornbread and most of all, big love for the service. Looking forward to my return."
2,"We had a lively and memorable rehearsal dinner at Le Select on the Friday evening of our wedding weekend, hosted graciously by my granny. We had about 60 people and used the Atelier space in the back of the restaurant overlooking the terrace. It was a wonderful affair and the staff at the restaurant couldn't have been more helpful, organized or pleasant to work with. 

I have been for brunch and dinner at Le Select a handful of times over the years and so I knew the food was classic and solid, but I had never been to a private event here. It was great! My mom and myself worked with Michelle Cummings, the special events coordinator, and she made everything a breeze for us.

Le Select brings a great balance of down to earth, but highly professional business and service. They have many options to choose from for your group and we ordered the suggested amount of canapés for our numbers; we did wine, beer, coffee, tea etc based on consumption; and a 3 course menu (printed and personalized for us) with 3-4 different options for each course listed which our guests could choose from at the time of ordering. We had the hard, but delicious choice of selecting the menu options, but Michelle was great with helping us appeal to the masses while still picking dishes that we love. 

On the night of the rehearsal dinner the staff were attentive and all of our flowers, menus, seating chart and table numbers had been set up. The parking for our guests was complimentary, which is fantastic (they have a private free lot in the back for patrons). There was space against the window where toasts/entertainment could occur and this happened after passed canapés when everyone went to their tables. If it was during the summer months, this sort of thing would ideally happen in the garden terrace for better viewing and acoustics.  Overall everything ran smoothly. 

It was a great way to kick off our wedding festivities with the bridal party and close family. I would highly recommend Michelle and their private events team if you are wanting to plan an authentic but unpretentious and charming smallish event downtown (min is 16 guests, max is listed at 70 guests if you rent out the Atelier space, but realistically 60-65 guests is optimal for comfort). 

Note: if you use the Atelier space in the warmer months you will have access to said outdoor terrace which would be lovely for canapés or even a harvest table set up outside."
2,"When I came here for brunch with friends, it was quite empty. Initially the servers kept coming back to ask for our orders, without giving us enough time to actually look through the menu. And after they took our orders, it was like they disappeared!

I found the design elements (industrial) to be lovely, but the food was just okay for me. The menu seems appealing, but as I do not eat pork, I found the options limiting for brunch without pork.

I ordered the an omelette dish that came with a delicious biscuit, some fruits and home fries.
My friends ordered the chicken and waffles and the eggs benny. Everything looked delightful. It also tasted delicious, if overfilling. We had to walk it off for awhile hehe.

I think I would come back to visit the General Store in the back of the restaurant, but as I found the options limiting (in terms of non-pork dishes) I probably wouldn't return to the restaurant itself. Still it was an enjoyable brunch."
2,"I had to log back in to my account after 3 years of inactivity specifically just to help this place out.  

I have been to the original Holy Chuck location several times over the past few years, and I can confidently say that this one is just as good as the original location.  This is simply one of the best burgers that you can get in Toronto, and their fries and poutine are equally outstanding.  Everything is outreageously flavorful and the meat used for the burger is extremely fresh and tasty.

As for all the people complaining that the food is too greasy/salty....it's a burger....did you expect it to be healthy and low in calories?  A juicy burger is the best thing you can ask for when it comes to unhealthy foods, and if you sacrifice that component of it then you end up with a dry, mediocre burger. If you want something healthy, sad and flavorless...go eat at a vegan restaurant.

Well done once again Holy Chuck, keep up the good work!"
1,"Always a good choice for inexpensive, tasty fast food.  Service is efficient, neither rude, but certainly not friendly.  I always leave satisfied with my food and the experience always meets my expectations."
3,"Small salads, overpriced for how much protein you're getting, chicken is extremely bland, do not pay attention to food allergies, if you're ordering online, they  are always late and get your order wrong."
3,"My friend and I were walking around King West and stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We were planning on going to another restaurant down the street but decided to give this place a try. Honestly I regret this decision because the food was mediocre and not worth the price. I had the Gringo and my friend had the benny. Plates were quite bare and very average tasting. I had to ask the server for butter which he essentially took two slabs from a brick of butter that was hardly melted. I would not come back again, this place is only nice for pictures."
2,"Loved, loved, loved this restaurant. Loved the atmosphere, loved the food and the waiter.  Our reservations were for 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday and the place was hopping. Considering it was so busy, we didn't find it loud at all. Great wine selection, our waiter recommended a delicious bottle of vinho verde, (Muros Antigos). We started with the charcuterie board, shared the alaskan king crab cakes, truffle gnocchi (to die for, wish I had the plate to myself - next time) and the crispy Quebec duck confit. It was enough for the 3 of us. We can't wait to go back!!!!!"
1,"Now under new management this place is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Fast service, good food, friendly servers. A++ in my books. It has a laid back atmosphere that I prefer over Guu (which I find too noisy for my liking). 

The polar beers are a must - such a great photo to take.

Compared to other izakaya restaurants, I find the portion size here to be larger. Perfect to share with 2 other friends. It has good variety of food. Everything from delicious meat skewers, fresh sushi, filling rice bowls and noodles. I would definitely recommend coming here."
3,"Great atmosphere. Staff is really helpful. Really chill and casual place to hang out with friends or on a date. Food/drinks are good, but can get kinda pricey. Lots of games available. I def felt nostalia when I saw some of them. Or if you're up for learning a new game, the staff is there to teach you or make some suggestions :)"
1,"Tom's is at a brilliant location: Queen and Ossington - so it gets its fair share of CAMH (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health) clients, so it's not without some fun.

The menu is cheap (but jumped recently: the $2.75 hamburger went up to $2.95), and the service is fast.  There are a few women who work there - the younger ones are spot-on, but Tom's wife is only pleasant if it's not too busy.

Grab a table, order breakfast - the bacon is lovely; the portions are big."
2,"Not terrible, but far from decent. I've been here a handful of times because it's close to home and the quality has been really inconsistent. Sometimes the chickens are spot on, crispy, perfectly fried and juicy on the insider but other times (most of the time...) they're overdone. It really sucks when they're overfried, the skin is tough and lacks crunch and the inside is also tough and dry. It's always a gamble when I come here."
2,"Walking through the polished wood doors at Bar Mercurio, transports the bloor street pedestrian into Europe. Or a bougie facismile thereof. 

Either way, the long narrow room, beautiful bar, royal blue accents, little round tables and open kitchen make for a pleasing space, while the simple Italian menu (salad, pizza and pasta) and good Italian wine list pleasure the mouth. 

I'm addicted to the calabrese pizza with a douse of chili oil for good measure; but regularly wish I could also order an omelette (comes topped with sour cream and caviar). The pastas are well done, though the gnocchi is often heavy in texture. Of the salads, I've only tried the tuscan bean, which has been different each time, and never really on the mark (too much bean; too much chicken; too much onion; not enough of anything etc.). 

All in all, its my favourite place on this part of Bloor West, and a lovely spot to enjoy a glass of wine and some well done thin crust za."
2,"All I can say is it's the bomb dot com! My friend and I were told the wait would be about 45 mins to an hr.  But good thing we waited because after 20 mins,  we ended up getting the window seats which we totally didn't mind.

My friend and I shared the nacho chips with guac. 
I recommend the friday special - oxtail taco! Delish!  Will def.  be back again in the future!"
2,"Outstanding food and service.   As of 2015 these guys are the undisputed Pizza champions of Toronto.  IMO. 

Pasta was great too."
3,"I am going to give this location 4 stars right across the board. Great atmosphere, fun menu and good service but a little on the pricey side compared to similar joints. The portions could be a little larger, but sometimes you pay for atmosphere and the experience, but it's worth it here. They also have a nice selection of alcoholic beverages as well."
2,"Omg. I love this wholesome and local concept. Parka does an amazing job of serving up vegan comfort food in tasty and simple but delicious ways. I don't normally eat this type of food so I consider it a treat (a good burger, vegan or not, still has the traits and heaviness of a burger) and one I would gladly indulge in when I want something that satisfies. Truffle Mac and cheese is bomb. I went to an event which they catered for recently and they did an awesome job."
2,"I went to Rush Lane last Wednesday with 3 friends (one of whom joined us maybe 15 minutes after we sat down).  I'm getting ahead of myself though.  My two friends and I had been waiting outside chatting for a bit before entering the restaurant.  When we finally went inside, we looked around first because we weren't sure if we should just sit at any table or wait for someone to seat us.  At the back of the restaurant, three of the bartenders were standing and chatting and they actually looked over at us (and then away from us, as one of my friends informed me) without greeting us or helping us to get settled in.  We took our seats anyway and actually had a short discussion about whether or not to leave.  We decided to stay once our fourth friend confirmed she was still coming but not to order any of the food items (obviously we wanted to try the cocktails but didn't want to spend more given the service).

After what seemed like a very long time, one of the bartenders finally  came over to greet us.  Luckily, he was friendly enough.  He was also helpful in advising us on which cocktails to order.  I ordered the Daniel's Hammer (the one with the vodka that is banned in the States, apparently).  Two friends ordered the Beat It and one ordered the Chai-Tai.  The Daniel's Hammer was sort of \""grassy\"" or \""green\"" in taste but I liked it (the bartender described it as sweet and savory, which it was).  My friends liked their Beat It's.  I'm not sure how much my fourth friend liked her Chai-Tai since she took very long to finish it.  
We ended up staying at Rush Lane for perhaps 1.5 hours, much longer than I had anticipated but we were really enjoying our conversation.  The waitress who stopped by to process our bills was also pleasant.

The washrooms are clean.  I liked the garage door window at the front.  Ambiance - definitely HIPSTER!  Can't say anything about the food (obviously).  I'm not going to write off Rush Lane or the staff completely - I would return and I HOPE that they will be more welcoming."
1,"Never been here before, but saw the great reviews for this place and have been meaning to try the food here for while. Had a look through the menu and everything was moderately priced but also looked ike snack size. 

So, I ordered a negitama gyudon and takoyaki for dinner today. The food arrived super fast. And looked nice at first glance. But upon eating... Boy, what a real disappointment. The food was awful. The rice in my don was mushy and wet/soggy and the gyudon was bland! It not like the rice was wet from the sauce, it was wet from too much water. Like as if a total noob made the rice. To give a better idea, I would say it tasted like I was eating plain congee with overboiled pieces of meat (super rough/dry) that also tasted like nothing. My egg on top had more seasoning than the meat... I could not even finish this meal as everything tasted like bland congee. I would not recommend having any rice dishes here. 

The takoyaki was not the best I've had. But at least there was taste. This place does not have the best takoyaki in toronto. There was too much wet dough in the centre as the takoyaki balls were quite large...as large as golfballs or maybe even larger? So, they were also mishaped and not round. 

Well, I'm glad I have finally tried this place though, now I can finally stop wondering."
2,About the only 24hr joint I know in TO that does passable food. The brunches are ok but I did have pretty much the worst burger ever there. It was just a distasteful piece of unseasoned meat on a platter-   this is a go to place when you are looking to soak up the alcohol at 3am....
1,"Had delivery yesterday and was pleasantly surprised, a great new addition to the neighborhood!  Veggies were fresh, not skimpy on meat portions and excellent taste on sauces/curries, need I say more? 

Ok to add a little more detail, had the spring rolls, green curry, red curry, pad Thai, and mango salad. Everything was decent and good. I will be eating here again, next time hopefully trying dining in!"
2,"Since this place is a half a block from our hotel, we thought we'd try it out.

We ordered two beers and an order of the szechuan chicken. Since this place has mixed reviews, we thought we'd try it out and order more food if we like it.

I spoke with the very friendly server and told him we liked spicy food and most places don't have spicy food. He claimed their food was very spicy and very good and we would be very happy with it.

The chicken dish came and my wife and I had a bit each. Very little spice and the sauce was boring. Tasted like basic soy sauce. We stopped eating and asked for the check.

We got the check and were charged for the full dish we didn't eat. No offer to reduce the bill or fix the dish. We probably shouldn' t have left a tip, but we did.

Would go back. They might have good dishes, but the one we had wasn't one of them."
2,"Went here with a friend after an event at Steam Whistle. 

Food: We sat for more than ten minutes before we were even asked if we wnted to order food. Once our waiter finally walked by, we asked to order food, in which he told use to hold on cause he was greeting other guests at the door. So they were clearly short/under staffed since the server was also doing host duties which took away from our level of service. 
Um rude!!!!! When he finally came back,
we ordered the shrimp tacos & fried pickles. Everything was just OK. ...the one thing I could appreciate was that the breading was \""real\"" and not like sime sort of panko batter. 

Service: Brutal!!!! Tuesday night and was not even busy. We sat on the bar side and there was only one other customer, an older gentleman who had the one waitress working sit down on the job and have a drink with him. She then proceed  to lean completely over the bar for an ass showing to her customer. (what seemed like a shameless attempt at getting a bigger tip) This went on for a good ten minutes. During our whole meal, no one even once came over to ask how things were. Only at the end when paying our bill did our waiter even speak more than 3 words to me.

Return??? Not sure...but highly unlikely/doubtful."
1,"Favourite local bar! They've got great drink specials all day every day. ($5 pour of the day & $3.50 select shots) the staff are beyond friendly, and always willing to engage in a conversation. Brunch & build your own caesar bar on the weekends!"
2,"Such a gem! This place has character and is so quaint you just want to stay there forever. 

Service was great, and the atmosphere inside makes you go back in time. 

We had the cake of the day and tea which was perfect for sharing and catching up with a friend. 

Our new favourite place, definitely will be back!"
2,"Nice Japanese izakaya with a variety of menu items - the baked oysters, kabocha pumpkin croquette, unagi doria, and okonomiyaki were delicious."
1,"I partly credit the start of my \""foodie\"" hobby to Nuit and Jeff, owners and operators of Pai. I first saw the duo at work during a cooking showcase at a food festival at the Harbourfront Centre back in 2009. Their cooking style really piqued my interest, and I decided  I needed to  visit their only restaurant at the time, Sukhothai. 

Back then, their shop was in a seedier neighbourhood near sherbourne and college. I recall walking there with a friend one fall evening and being unsure if we were headed in the right direction since everything seemed closed and the street was eerily quiet. As we approached our destination using the maps on our blackberry bolds, we saw one lone restaurant opened at a near distance. Inside was brightly lit and teeming with patrons inside. It was that night that I realized the joy of discovering  hidden restaurant gems in the 6ix (or t.dot as it was once called ;-)).

Each of Nuit and Jeff's restaurants (Pai, Sukhothai, Sabai Sabai) deliver delicious food. Having traveled to Thailand, I'd argue their menu covers a good portion of the foods traditionally available in Thailand. That being said, the curry dishes tend to be less intensely flavored and made more suitable for the western palette, which is perfectly fine. My guilty pleasure is the Pad Thai. Nuit and Jeff's pad Thai was the first I ever really fell in love with here in Toronto. The dish is a perfect combination of savory, sweet, salty and sour elements, and leaves you feeling nicely satisfied.

I would say that Pai is a solid 4.5 / 5 for the price segment it competes in. The one thing that would bring it closer to a five would be if it introduced some of the other local foods from Thailand (e.g. omelettes, soups and grilled meats)."
2,Tried Outlet by High Park - pleasant experience with good taste & quality food servings. In future will try the Scarborough restaurant which is closer to home.
2,"Came here for brunch with a friend, and not gonna lie, I was extremely tempted to order mac and cheese at 10:30 a.m.! We ended up getting more traditional brunch items. The eggs en sugo were perfectly cooked in a delicious tomato sauce, and toasty bread. My brunch buddy loved her French toast. Cappuccino was on point. We loved the yummy food, and great, friendly service! Cute neighbourhood place. You know a place is great when even the non-specialty dishes are awesome! I can't wait to come back to try the mac and cheese!"
2,"We were looking for a great breakfast place and boy did we ever find one! We ended up having to wait about 45 minutes to just get in the door but the food made up for the wait. From the hot chocolate, to the waffles, to the eggs Benedict, everything was out of this world! If I lived in Toronto I would definitely become a regular here."
2,When eating at Pho restaurants 99% of the time I will order vermicelli with grilled pork and a spring roll (bun thit nuong). With that being said Anh Dao is at top of my list.  Cash only.
2,"We found out about this Smokehouse through Yelp, and made the trip this weekend to sample their Smoked Goods! Mmm! Loved it!

The lineup to get served was quite long (1/3 of the way through the store), but the smoky scent wafting through the establishment had us drooling and distracted while we waited to be served.

We ordered a lot of items for take-out and they weighted them, wrapped them in butcher's paper, and packed them for us.

We couldn't wait to get home to sample their Smoked meats...

The Beef Brisket was awesome. 'Nuff said! It comes without any BBQ sauce, so you can add their house sauce if you want (we didn't).

The Side ribs were excellent (The PitBoss mentioned he wouldn't even think about doing Baby Back Ribs), but, I prefer Back Ribs. Nevertheless, the dry rub and and smoked flavour was heavenly. (again, no sauce, just dry rub and smoked, so you can enjoy it without any added sugar sauces)

Their home-made pork sausages were spiced just right! Mmm!

Cole Slaw was great. Not too much sugar, and a nice hint of jalapeño peppers mixed in! Didn't try the other sides, but, they looked great.

Service at the counter was fast and friendly. They take Cash, debit, and credit.

We found out they are licensed, and had a nice selection of craft beers available if you chose to dine in-house. We may try this the next time we visit."
3,"I love buffets. This was pretty low on quality. Food was over cooked, or under cooked, the selection wasn't very good, and the condition inside wasn't all that great. I would not have paid that much for my meal at all. Not impressed."
2,"Was there with a friend of mine during the week for dinner. It was busy, but our waitress had enough time to crack a few jokes with us and really explain the menu. The drinks were crafted to my liking, the service was pleasant and cheery (Thank you Malerie & Candice), and the food speak worlds for itself. Will need to go again to make sure I wasn't dreaming."
1,Bindia is right across the way from the St. Lawrence Market. There is an extensive vegetarian menu. Food was well prepared. Service was efficient. Prices are fair.
2,"I feel like such an imposter in this store.

However, nothing gets between me and my NARS & Laura Mercier. 

Imagine my surprise when I walked into Holt's today (honestly - is a doorman fucking necessary?) and saw a Shu Uemura counter immediately upon entering.

I shrieked. Audibly. And dropped my bags. It was a scene out of Legally Blonde to be sure. 

I am furious with myself - how did I not know that there's been a Shu Uemura counter at Holt's in Yorkville since July 2009?? UGH. I've been traipsing across the continent stocking up on Smoky Layers (http://www.shuuemura-usa.com/_us/_en/accessories/false-eyelashes/natural/false-eyelashes-smoky-layers.htm), the most amazing falsies of all time. No longer. 

Violet, a gorgeous, Amazonian woman with a sweet disposition, hooked me up with a few pairs for $25/apiece. Not cheap, but indispensable and they're a bargain if you reuse them 10x each like I do. Get it sorted, and get your ass down to Holt's. The cosmetics department is daunting, but if you know what you're looking for

P.S.: Nothing at the NARS counter is in stock, ever. I've gone four times in as many months in search of a Red Square lip pencil and the angry looking woman cockney-slash-Arabic accent has sternly told me that \""reds are on back order to all of Canada\"" each time. eBay it is!"
2,Went for lunch here today and they were not open despite signs and website saying the open at 11(sign outside) and 11:30(on website)
2,Very nice food . Tried the shrimp sandwich ! It's so good ! I would rate it around 4.5 stars . Leaving a review to remind myself to come back here again when in the area !
2,"Went here with a group of colleagues for lunch.   We had a great time and the food was fantastic.  We were a group of 5 and we ordered a plate each.  

I ordered a pizza the Calabrisella, which has tomato sauce, mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, parmigiano, n'duja, basil. The smaller size is $19.00 and has 6 large slices.   The combination of ingredients on this pizza was Devine! The best part was the crust! 

For dessert we had a bombolone, this delicious doughnut was filled with Nutella.   I could not stop eating it!  I bought a mini one and I knew I should have ordered the larger portion.   

If you are looking for a great chic place to have a friendly lunch I would definitely stop by Sudforno!"
2,I was super excited to try North Poké but I left disappointed. The service was really slow considering we were the only ones there. I normally believe in quality over quantity but the quality was not to par neither was the quantity.
2,"I came here with a friend on a Wednesday night at around 9:30PM. The location wasn't too difficult to find but the entrance leads to a set of stairs that you have to go up so the location did not appear to be wheelchair accessible -as far as I know. 

Once we entered I noticed that there was around 6 or 8 booths lining the walls with a TV mounted on each while the middle had smaller tables. The booths can fit 6 people comfortably and there were areas to play more elaborate games that take up more space, such as Rock band/guitar hero in the corners - though that area was restricted during our stay.

I was told that you just had to purchase something from the menu to play games but the staff member told us that we can get situated before we came up to order. The place was fairly busy when we got there, almost all the booths were occupied and the middle section had some some customers seated as well. They have a binder beside the bookshelf next to the enterance with all the game stations and games offered which I thought was very helpful. Additionally, there were plenty of board games and even multiples of some (such as Avalon, resistance, and one night werewolf) in the shelves. 

The board games you can grab off the shelf, as for the game stations you have to let the staff know after you have decided on what you want. Xbox 360, PS3 and the Wii are just some of the stations offered here, they have more stations - some old ones like the Nintendo 64 as well. If you are unfamiliar with setting up the stations, the staff will be able to help you out, as they offered when I picked out the Wii (later got rekt in game by my friend). 

I got the Matcha Latte (~$6), which came with some classic latte art. The matcha flavour was prominent and the bitterness was to my liking, would order again. My friend got a green tea ($3, I don't remember the exact name), which was just your typical green tea BUT they did say if more hot water was needed- just ask and they'll provide which was a nice touch. There was a good selection of teas to choose from. The kitchen/cafe closed approximately an hour before the location closes so I'd suggest getting here before 11pm but that's not such a hard requirement to meet. 

Overall it was a positive experience and I would definitely drop by again!

This review is NOT based on the escape rooms that's offered here. 

Tip: if you see a game station in a booth unattended and you want to use it, let the staff know first instead of grabbing it yourself!"
1,"My wife and I decided to head on down to Toronto's Sugar Beach for the afternoon on Saturday.  After our visit there we were looking for a close place to have some lunch and sit on the patio.  We walked about 2 min from Sugar Beach and located in the Corus Entertainment building beside the beach we found \""Against the Grain Urban Tavern\"".

Location:
If your downtown, then parking is always an issue.  We parked at the Loblaws across the street for $10 bucks, but I was reading a tip that if you park at the Corus Building and you dine at Against the Grain Urban Tavern, you will get the cost of your parking taken off your bill ($10 dollars). The actual location faces Lake Ontario, and with ample patio space (30-40 tables plus lounge seating) and sufficent indoor seating this location is prime for those looking for a summer patio experience

Service:
Excellent, looks like a ton of staff. Our server came within 2 min, drink orders within 2 min, explanation of menu items, apps in 10 min, refills, prebussing, food runners, table checks, quick bill delivery.  I can't say anything bad about the service.

Food:
Interesting take on upscale casual.  We started with the Handmade Perogies with Kielbassa sausage ($13). I have always associated perogies with a doughy cheesy goodness with a little pan fry cripsyness. These were more like a Phlyo pastry version of perogies, light and fluffy.  Still very good, but different. Our entrees came up about 5 min finishing up our apps.  I ordered the Nasi Goreng ($16), basically its an Indonesian dish of Fried Rice cooked in soy and tamarind. It comes with a fried egg or you can have it with grilled chicken (+$5). Very tasty..I am filipino and having your eggs with rice is old hat for me, but this was very good.  My wife had the grilled cheese 2x4 with tomato soup ($10). She was a fan of the grilled cheese, but the soup was a too saucy in consistency for her.  Just a side note: other dishes that we saw when they were delivering to other tables looked awesome (flatbreads, burgers, fish and chips). 

Against the Grain Urban Tavern, good food, excellent service, nice view of the lake, ample patio space and trendy decor. I wouldn't mind coming back in the evening to sit and relax by the outdoor fireplaces for some eats and drinks"
2,"Just when you thought the Yonge and Sheppard area in North York already had enough Korean restaurants, along comes another. Except Han Ba Tang is a breath of fresh air. 

For starters, they have one of the best korean bars. House infused sojus that can be ordered in a flight (4 generous glasses in a flight for $15) or in their cocktails. I loved the cucumber and apple cinnamon sojus the most! The Live to 1000 cocktail (henessy + ginseng + honey) was also a delicious hard hitter.

The Spicy Pork tacos here are probably the best thing on the menu, followed closely by the Kimchi and Bulgogi fries. Yes, KIMCHI AND BULGOGI ON CRISPY FRIES. Sorry Banh Mi Boys, you've been ousted as the king of kimchi fries.

The spoon pizza (mashed sweet potato \""crust\"" with vegetables, tomato sauce, topped with cheese and bacon or kimchi) is a great dish to share when drinking - it is literally carbs on carbs topped with a GINORMOUS layer of melted cheese. Can't really ask for more.

Pro Tip: If you end up ordering the Spicy Seafood soup and have left overs, take it home and cook ramen with it. The soup is so flavourful with all the good seafood it's stewed with. You won't regret it!"
2,"I came here based on the recommendation of the hotel concierge. The ambiance is old school but cozy. The highlight of my meal was the Caesar salad. The salmon was ok, but needed extra flavor. I asked for extra lemon and the bartender grabbed two lemon wedges with her hands and put on my plate. Not an acceptable move in this day and age. 

Speaking of this day and age why don't they have guest wifi?"
1,"Felt very authentic and the ingredients tasted great. 

The potatoes from the shrimp & polpo was so tender, however the baby octopus was a little too mushy. 

The mushroom & truffle on toast was so aromatic. It was definitely good quality truffle oil .

We shared the fresh fusilli pasta with Porchetta. The pasta, as promised, was freshly made. It was soft but enough al dente for my liking. 

The reason I couldn't give it a 5 stars was due to a staff - the waitress who packed up our leftovers and gave us the bill. I swear, i would have made a fuss, but decided to remain complacent in the next scenario. She was cleaning our table and then dropped the fork into my lap. Good thing it didn't end up stabbing me (I was wearing shorts) and no real apology after the accident and then when she came back with the bill and the debit machine, she abruptly asked us how we would like to pay without even giving us time to see the bill first. I said, we'll check the bill first and get back to you (it was very abrupt and unmannerly). With that said, she immediately left our table without any acknowledgement. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I just felt I would ignore the attitude once again and leave this girl to her herself because I really wanted to end my weekend off on a good note, instead of what she projected to us. 

Overall:
- food, 5 stars (great, affordable)
- service: 1 (though our first waitress was great and sweet)"
2,"I came in on a whim and only ordered two items - the xiao long bao and the scallion pancakes. They were good but not like, outstandingly good. Service was fast and friendly for an Asian restaurant. I would go back again but with more people so I can try out more things and not look like a pig eating so many different items."
2,"We went there a couple of weeks ago, and were impressed with service, food, and atmosphere. Very nice size portions and excellent menu, with lots to choose from. Even my finicky mother-in-law loved it there, which is a BIG deal in our family.
We will definitely go there again."
2,"Average dim-sum restaurant amongst many in Chinatown. But this one is ALL DAY DIM SUM. I came to Rol-San because they had many reviews on yelp compared to the other dim-sum places (perhaps because they're \""all-day\""). I was seated immediately, given an \""order-card\"" and got to work. I ordered 10 dishes ranging from veggies, meat, soup, and a milk tart dessert. My total came out to be around $50, they also charge each person $1 for tea! The dim-sum dishes were either a hit or miss, but my favorite had to be the rice noodle with donut inside. Service was decent, and I have no complaints there. However, I'll stick with NYC dim-sum from now on, theres just something about the dim-sum carts rolling around with piping hot dishes that just makes my mouth water!"
2,Wowwwwww this food was so good!!!!! Nice environment and lovely staff! Blown away. My friends and I had a wonderful time!
3,"Wife and I used to come here once or twice a week for breakfast and then go shopping. Back when breakfast was $0.99.

The new breakfast is $2.49 or $2.99... the breakfast sausages are smaller and taste weird due to lesser quality meat. Clearly a price jump while adding two tiny slices of tomatoes, and a small slice of bread.

While the change is still a reasonable deal, it is no longer an amazing deal.

Due to proximity we will be switching to having breakfast at a mom n pop style place closer to home... near a Canadian Tire. So I guess CT will be getting our business from now on."
2,"My favorite place for tacos, nachos, bean dip and guac in the city. Can't believe it has taken me so long to review! Bathroom is tiny."
2,"Skip this place. I waited in line for a few minutes as there was only one employee at the counter. By the time I was at the counter and it was my turn to order, I'd already spent too much time waiting in line so I decided to stick with it despite seeing how stale everything looked. There was a dried crust/film on top of and around the sides of almost every dish of beans and meat.
I ordered a large chicken burrito. The chicken contained a lot of cartilage. The chipotle sauce was watery and tasteless, as was the sour cream which came out of a squeeze bottle and definitely didn't have the consistency or taste of sour cream. I asked for medium-hot salsa, but the only choices were hot and mild. The hot salsa was barely mild. THEY WERE OUT OF CILANTRO!!! Finally, they didn't toast the tortilla before or after wrapping so it ended up a soggy, raw, chewy mess. Oh, and the \""large\"" burrito was about 5 inches long and very thin - not large by any measure. It takes some nerve to serve this up to paying customers. Nothing against the people that work there, but the owner or franchisee really needs to step up and get things fixed. This is absolutely heinous. I wasn't made physically ill, so that's a plus."
2,"Homemade dumplings and noodles is what we were aiming for. Got their ja jiang mien, boiled as well as steamed dumplings, xiao long bao, and beef rolls. Xiao long bao were great (eat while hot or be careful removing from the paper bottom) but the boiled dumplings were juicy too (and you get a dozen an order). 

The steamed dumplings we got were a little tougher in terms of the skin and the filling, but I'm not dinging them on it since it just might be my taste and my dad had placed the order anyways. 

Ja jiang mien was right on. Our table of five got a complimentary dessert (my parents were chatting up the staff - so be nice!) ;)

Beef rolls were great too (we had been to Vancouver recently where we found ourselves ordering them everywhere we went).

There's a few more small plate options there (we put off the leek and egg pancakes in favor of more dumplings). So inexpensive to try and easy to share.

We're visiting from States and they were kind enough to offer us their wifi access to scout our next stop. (Don't miss the Phoenix Bakery nearby)"
2,"Jen and I are always on the look-out for any new dessert places to visit.  Thankfully, one not too far was Snow Time, a cool Korean dessert place that's serving up some shaved ice desserts...called Bingsu (I think that's what it's called).
Not sure how long this place has been opened for, but its popular! 

Injeolmi Bingsu is what Jen and I shared.  Served in a big bowl, flavored shaved milk ice, topped off with sweet thick evaporated milk. Please keep in mind this dish takes at least 10 min to prepare.  

Pom tea is what we opted for drinks, something warm, soothing to a perfect experience.
This place is a gem for those who live close to here.
I'll be back!"
2,"Sunset Grill is my good ol' reliable brunch place.

If I'm having brunch in the Bloor/Church area, I alternate beween Sunset Grill and Lola's Commissary.  It depends on who I'm eating with.

I found that  Sunset was an easier place to eat for people with allergies.

One of my friends has a gluten allergy and another friend is allergic to sesame seeds.  It's surprising how many places use seasame crusted bread to make french toast (Sunset doesn't)!

I always order the same thing here, the Sunset Super..
And it sure is super delicious and filling!
It's a real breakfast.
Sausage and/or bacon (I do both), 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, and of course home fries!

My cup of coffee always seems bottomless!  
I've never had an issue with service here.

This place may not be trendy, but for casual diner style brunch, this place has never let me down!"
2,"An update to a previous review: I stand by my previous review for Swiss Chalet as a restaurant chain; however, this specific location suffers from inconsistent service. Some staff are great but many are really awful. Can't decide if it is because they are overworked or just undertrained, but either way it impacts the dining experience at this location."
2,"I used to love this place - it's reasonably priced, good food & close to my house. I am not going back anymore however because I just can't stand the service.  I went for dinner with a group last night for dinner and drinks and the service was very slow.  We had a reso & our table was not ready when we got there.  Our server was nice enough, but a lot of people in my party sat with empty glasses for a long time.  After dinner we stayed for another round of drinks   & our server did not clear our plates from dinner.  So we had dirty dishes on our table for two hours after we finished eating.  This isn't the first time I've had slow, disappointing service there, so enough."
2,Hmm~ Yujie and I tried two different one squid and beef. they have amazing sauces~~~~~ like it~~~~
2,"The traditional china town restuarant

Good value and good BBQ meat! The meat is always so flavourful. 
Outside and inside is not appealing at all but if the food is good you end up going back for more!

Just don't expect great service and the takeout line takes forever during lunch hour. but still worth the wait."
1,"Came here for a friend's birthday and this place is perfect for large group considering how big most of their seafood dishes are.  First let's talk about the food.  This place is known for their seafood, you can do anything from crab, lobsters, fish and anything you can think of that is edible from the sea.  Also, there are many flavours you can choose from on how you want your food to be cooked in.  With a group of 12+, we had lobsters, king crab legs, rice, fish and a veggie dish which were all included in a meal combo we ordered.  Overall the seafood are pretty fresh and they are well-made.  They also give you plastic gloves, so you can eat everything with your hand and it makes digging meat out from shells that much easier.

Only thing I do not like about this place is all servers will try to upsell you to go with the more expensive \""combo\"" no matter how many people you have.  I am guessing servers get commission on up-selling?  This way of doing business really irritates me.

Price wise, this place is on the high end, but considering how good the food and how fresh the seafood were, I thought the price justifies itself.

In conclusion, this place is good to come with a large group of seafood lover, also do not be persuaded by the up-selling tactics from the servers and you should be able to enjoy a good meal"
2,"I love this place, and so do my parents who are very picky and like the food to taste like \""back home\"". The girls who work here are very nice, food is always delicious."
2,"3.5 stars.

In the restaurant wasteland that is the financial district (or so it seemed), beerbistro stands out as a decent option. With dozens and dozens of beer options, including some really nice Belgian beers for reasonable prices.

The mussels and frites here were solid, though they need to be a little better about bringing you a bowl for your empty mussels shells. The lunch crowd here is mostly business folks and it gets really crowded really fast. 

Overall the food is solid and the beer list is worth checking out."
3,"The place has been around for eons now. After getting put on a long wait list at Constantine, we decided to eat here for old times sake. 

The place hasn't changed much over the years. Since it's last iteration, everything is white, which adds a sophisticated touch, but that's about the only sophistication really. 

The menu tries too hard, with trying too hard prices. The drinks have the same issue. The service is a bit too much as well. It's right at the border of having so much potential, but perhaps a manager or owner who's just missing the mark in terms of vision. 

Come here if it's easy, but don't come here if you're craving a particular experience."
2,"Wow! I just had to give an updated review for multiple reasons:
1. After my first review, Pete had replied to my message so soon after. I like the care he shows towards the business and customers.

2. My boyfriend had ordered from the Basil Box and couldn't finish his food. So he offered it to me. From what I saw, he got jasmine rice with peppers, corn, steak, tamarind sauce and loads of fun toppings. I was amazed by how well seasoned the steak was, how flavourful the entire bowl was. And hurray, the portions size definitely did a big upgrade.

3. To make sure it wasn't a fluke, I got myself a meal. Today I decided to try jasmine rice with peppers, corn, coconut curry tofu, penang curry (just a warning if you can't eat spicy, it's got a nice medium spicy kick so might wanna avoid that), and the fun top your box stuff. Again, full of flavour and great portions.

4. The people here are very very friendly and enthusiastic to serve you. It's really rare to see all staff come up to approach with such positive manner and be really genuine about it.

5. Got the Thai iced tea again. It's bomb. I should really try the other drinks because they sound really great and unique :)

Voila! Basil Box you get 5/5 :D"
2,"What  a friendly place with  great food! The atmosphere is very RED GREEN, warm cozy & comfortable. A good selection of beer & draft ,and the cocktails are varied & tasty. Try the Wings,they were the best  I've  had in a long time! The service was friendly and professional. Really had a great meal ! There is a really  nice menu ,with lots of choices. Give this place try, I am sure you will be pleased ."
2,"Pasteur is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. 

The pho broth is very flavorful without being too oily.  If you like things spicy, request satay in your pho and you will be treated to the pinnacle of pho delights. The rare beef is fresh and nicely sliced. Get a large if you are very hungry and your hungry will be satiated quite nicely.

The rice dishes are also very good. My particular favourite is the grilled beef with rice (I often opt for an additional fried egg on top). The beef is nicely grilled, with subtle seasonings and garlic. The rice is generously piled on the plate.. Drizzle the fish sauce over the dish and it transforms into an exquisite masterpiece revealing itself with every bite.

The fresh fruit shakes are also noteworthy. Try the green bean, pennyleaf, and coconut."
2,"Normally i would give this place a minimum 4 stars, but i was recently disappointed by my recent brunch visit as their service and professionalism didn't meet expectations. We made a reservation for 11am for our brunch meal, arrived well before our seating time and waited till 11:20 for the restaurant to even OPEN before we finally decided to just leave. I know it's not a critique of their food which, on a more positive note, is normally very good. I'm just upset over it and needed to express my experience. We called the restaurant several times while waiting and even replied to their confirmation text earlier that morning. Big disappointment, enough to keep us away for awhile. They really defined true \""Filipino time\""."
2,"I agree with previous review by Josh K. It's possible that some of the reviews aren't for the correct restaurant since there are a few restaurants with Sichuan in its name in Toronto. Some of those ratings seem unfair if it is indeed the correct restaurant.

In any case, I was walking around Chinatown looking for a restaurant that accepts Mastercard. Unfortunately, I couldn't use Yelp as I didn't have internet service as I was visiting Toronto from the US.  So I stumbled into this restaurant after seeing they accept Mastercard (if you spend $10+) and I'm glad I did. First of all, I was pleasantly surprised with its modern decor and clean, updated bathroom. The chairs were really comfortable and much needed after walking around so much. 

But the real star of the show was the food. I got the Kung Pao Chicken and a beef dish with onions (can't remember the name). But both were delicious and I would say Sichuan Landscape rivals the best Chinese resto in Tampa (Yummy House) in terms of taste. I'm really quite surprised at the negative reviews but I do understand the comments about bad service, which is why I deducted a star.  I had to flag the waitress down to refill my drink and  she didn't check up on us.  Considering I was Yelpless, I think this restaurant was a good find and I'd recommend it."
2,"I arrived in Toronto for a business trip and ended up at Tundra because it was the closest place to eat other than Ruth Chris. The ambiance is pure business hotel lobby and I wasn't expecting much from the food. I was really surprised. The menu was locavorish and quite interesting. I had the whitefish with spaetzle and cabbage. It was perfectly cooked, fresh and delicious. Even the dessert had an interesting presentation. The cocktail was tasty and the bartender made it to my specs. My service was efficient and friendly. I'm really surprised at the mediocre reviews for Tundra on Yelp. I had a very positive experience and would recommend it to other business travelers."
2,Came for company party. Outstanding experience. We ordered a variety and shared dishes. There are no wrong answers on the menu. Wonderful food.
2,"When you're visiting from the states, you don't want all the foods you can try back home.     This place is hard core french canadian quebecian.  

Had this meat pie thingie (never had something like this before.   Had this caramel like pie (tarte au sucre... another item I've never had before).   All in all, I wish I had more time to try out the rest of the quebecian food."
2,The hype is worth it.
2,"OMG!! Their cheese softserve ice cream is HEAVEN!!! It reminds me of baby milk formula which I LOVE!! I wish they sold them in tubs that you can take home. So unique and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. I give this a 5 star.

Their cheesetart barely has any cheese flavor to it. It tastes and feels like a custard, just fyi. They don't sell slices as take out so I had to cough up $15 for the whole tart which I am not fond of. I much prefer Uncle Tetsu's for a rich cheese flavor. YMMV. I give this one a 2 star.

Average rating is 3.5 stars."
2,"This is a vegan-friendly cafe in the space that used to be El Cafecito. I really love the patio on this space. It's removed from Bloor and quiet. Interior is small but beautiful.

They have vegan muffins, a vegan sandwich special (red pepper and hummus) and you can get jam on toast made from freshly baked bread or just buy a whole load here.

They also have quite a few beers available for when coffee won't do. 

Extra points for the name. Owners are super friendly."
2,"My fiance (now husband) and I booked the upstairs of Sassafraz for our small wedding. We wanted a nice dinner for our guests with a beautiful space and room for dancing - Sassafraz was terrific and fit our vision of the big day perfectly!

Dennette was awesome to work with and her friendliness helped make a stressful planning experience incredibly enjoyable. The setup/service and food on the day of the wedding was incredible. Our guests loved the food and the atmosphere and still days later we're getting so much positive feedback on the food and the venue.


I definitely recommend this venue for a small/medium size wedding!"
3,"You are paying a bit steep for 2 things... the experience and the view!

Okay, so it's a very touristy place.. that's the only reason why we are taking 1 star away.. At $150 for a meal, one enjoys a pretty nice meal in NYC. At 360 however, we weren't that impressed with the food. We got the $65, 2 course prix fixe option.. 1 appetizer and 1 main course... Mrs. got the ONTARIO LAMB SAUSAGE WITH MINTED SUMMER PEAS (which was really nice, but smaller portion) and I got the SMOKED TROUT AND POTATO CHOWDER (which was delicious, but portion wise, really small).

For main course, Mrs. got the ROASTED BONELESS HALF CHICKEN WITH GREEN OLIVE BUTTERMILK MASHED POTATO and I got the SMOKED PAPRIKA RUBBED NAGANO PORK TENDERLOIN WITH YELLOW PEPPER SOFRITO. The Pork seriously lacked flavor and was really dry and the Chicken wasn't seasoned at all.

Food wise, we didn't really enjoy our entrees... but experience wise, it was really fun.. something different!

Service was really nice. Lisa, our server, made sure we had a very nice and happy experience at 360!"
2,"The ambience is elegant and serene at this quietly cloistered gem and despite arriving with very high expectations, I was completely blown away by the new and delicious flavors that I experienced. We began with the beet salad and moved on to our main courses, the filet and the seafood dish; both of which were eye-opening and enlightening. We finished off with the milk and honey and a pair of cheeses that did not disappoint. Would absolutely recommend Scaramouche without reservation."
2,"Omg! food so good...staff so sweet...but food sooo good. I'm a very picky eater so its often very hard for me to find a place i like.. i tend to drift from bad experience to another. Yesterday I stopped at the red castle and had the Kofta plate, I kinda wanted to try other things but i never ate there before so i started with something safe and it was goooood mmm mmm good. don't let the display at the front fool you..its all made fresh. The experience was so authentic as i have lived in the middle east and know true middle eastern hospitality..try this place and you will see for yourself."
2,"The reason im giving it a 2 is because of the friendly service and quick service but my first experience on this restaurant is quite disappointing. I've been using yelp for reviews on places that I wanted to visit so it is my way of giving back to the yelp community by sharing my experience here.

I visited on a Saturday 5ish time where they opened for dinner servic eand I asked for kare-kare which I've been informed is no longer serve and they only changed their menu recently. Most of my disappointment is on food as i felt that it was all been prepared from yesterday.

---Lumpia is not fresh and felt that it was microwave, too much msg is what it is
---Garlic rice tasted like the bottom part of a rice cooker and definetly not fresh like it was from a yesterday's left over rice.
---Sisig, funny thing is she told me to be careful for the hot pan but pan definitely not that hot as sisig is supposedly sizzling and it is far from being a hot food, blandly tasted dish. 
--- Crispy pata is not so crispy, it tasted that it was fridge and was deep fried right away. It was far from Max's Crispy pata
---Leche Flan Brule is the only dish that i enjoyed and the bottled coke

For a Saturday, i was at least expecting fresh food and not a cold sisig, crusted garlic bottom fried rice and an average crispy pata which is supposedly their last dish to at least win me, for that reason I won't be back."
2,"This place is great. I came here once. Recommended it to a friend, came here again and still loved it.

The first time I got a bibimbap with beef, and the second time I got a gamjatang. The porkbone soup. It was great both Timex they ha e actual korean servers.

Only downside I can say is we had a lot of difficulty of grabbing someone attention and being forgotten.. It took over half an hour to finally finish paying. Other than that, servers were friendly and nice, food was A++."
2,"Not impressed. Made reservations on Open Table for 6pm. Called the restaurant as we were running late for 10 mins (due to unexpected delays at the subway). Got seated and ordered food and a bottle of rose wine. The rose was not chilled so they had to put it in a bucket of ice. So we waited. The small plates came in (applies such as zucchini fritters, Arabic fries) within a reasonable time. Larger plates (octopus and pide) took almost an hour (from time of ordering) to arrive. While waiting, got an email from Open Table that I was a no-show.

The food was ok, nothing extra special. Worst part was the service. Our server from the beginning was never to be seen again through the evening. It's almost as if the staff didn't really care. I would not go back to this place."
2,"I love McDonalds but this location is run by very poor operators. Every time I am in there and I had a hotel close by so I went there frequently particularly for breakfast, they screwed something up. Always check your order before leaving. And don't even think about eating inside as it is filthy. They were regularly out of routine items like butter or ice tea to name just two. No boxes for happy meals for my kid and no toy selection. Pretty embarrassing. The food was fine when they didn't mess up the order."
2,"My boyfriend and I are visiting from the States and heard great reviews about this place.  We were originally supposed to do the brewery tour but we were late so we just decided to have dinner here.  After waiting 30 minutes in line (we understand it's a busy place), we got seated at a high top under the covered patio.   We have been sitting there for almost an hour and quite a few workers have walked by.  No one bothered to acknowledge us.  Finally I asked a waitress if I could ask her a question.  She brushed me off and continued on her way.  After 20 more minutes, a lady who turned out to be the manager, asked us if anyone has been over.  We tell her no, we've been here for an hour, trying to get peoples attention but everyone just keeps walking by.   She said someone would be right over and someone finally came over.  She went over the menu and beers with us and then said she'd be back, but of course after having waited over an hour before we got acknowledged, we put in our order right away.  Who knows when our waiter/waitress will get back to us!!  We finally got our water after an hour.  I've never been to a place where I had to wait for over an hour for the waiter/waitress to come over.  This is just  ridiculous! 

Update: Our order was completely wrong.  The only things that were right were our drinks and appetizer.  Pizza was the wrong one, but still delicious.  A plate of fries came out all by itself.  After 20 minutes, I asked the waiter if my burger was coming.  Turns out it was never put in.  And when we did get it, it was cold.  The food and drinks were good, but the service was horrible!  Thank goodness we did not pay full price!"
2,"Brunch brunch brunch! Their menu has the usual brunch items. However, the real gem are the daily recommendations that your server will tell you about that are not on the menu. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a sunny side duck egg on top. The chicken was evenly battered and not overly greasy. The waffle was crispy and egg runny. We also got the omelet. However, nothing too special about the omelet. Great service though!"
2,"Today at 1pm the best thing ever happened. A second Northwood location, Northern Belle, opened near my house. 

I used to live near Northwood and frequented it far too often. I had my first coffee of the day there, I used their wifi for hours on end (some work, some wikipedia spiraling) and then would transition into night with a cocktail around 5pm. I can't fucking wait to start to do the exact same thing here. 

Same candlelit-wooden vibe, incredibly curated cockatil list and amusing cast of characters. This time with a patio a stone's throw to Trinity Bellwoods. A goddamn delight."
2,"Had the chicken Katsu, sous vide eggs and gyoza for lunch. Ordered on ritual and saved 6 bucks on first visit with 500 points. Big portion. Satisfying. Katsu is fresh and flavourful. Paper container is environmentally friendly. Self serving sauces. Love that the eggs are free ranged."
2,"Wow! First thing I'd have to mention is the beautiful building. The interior is done an old tudor style and lit with a wood burning fireplace - very cozy!
The staff was friendly and really knew the menu, ordering was a breeze.
The food earned five stars as well. I really enjoyed the cod dish and my boyfriend raved about his tenderloin all the way home!
If I had to correct one thing I'd play more modern music, bit because that's more of a preference thing I won't dock this restaurant a star. 
10/10 would return."
2,"Ordered 10 shrimps, 4 were brought to our table. Similar for other items as well. Service is just ok. Not the best hotpot."
1,"I've been creping it up for the past few weeks, sampling crepes from all over the city. 

Just in the past weeks I've been to Choco crepe, Crepe Delicious, Crepes a Go Go, my own kitchen even!, and now Crepe it Up :D

Environment:

Looks like a cute coffee shop to chill at. Not too large, there are 3 small round tables on far end, a bar stool setup for lined seating, and a couple more tables along the edge near the front entrance. Chalkboard menu and a pretty good selection of teas and coffees. 

Experience:

Today we tried a crepe, called the Paris. (Chocolate hazelnut spread, banana, and scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side) and chinese breakfast tea, although it was 6 o'clock in the evening lol 

We dug into the crepe, whoa I was surprised. This was great pairing of ingredients. It was delicious!   The crepe itself was soft and moist, sort of like a pancake flavour, not so eggy.

We enjoyed the crepe so much we ordered up another one called the Mexico which was sliced apple + Crème De Leche (caramel). Jeez after trying a few bites this too was another hit. The fresh sliced red apples were razor thin, and the caramel glaze providing a warm yummy coating to counter any tartness. 


Summary:

The crepes were perfect. On top of this they were not that expensive (under $5)

Recommend!"
2,"This weirdly upstairs diner is very good; much better than it needs to be. Ought to be?
Cookie in the back clearly cares about what he does, and the food comes out hot, right, well-thought and delicious.

Not a sign of a hot house tomato or a bagged lettuce leaf.

This totally exceeded my expectation.

When was the last time you got still-hot toast!!!!"
2,3.5 this place hits the spot when it comes to breakfast places.  simple and easy diner vibe.  its not extravagant but ita great for that quick easy breakfast.  service is decent as well.
1,"This review of Skin+Bones is based on my brunch experience.

Poached eggs over French lentils and mushrooms - Good
Fried Chicken  - meh I found the batter a little too heavy for my liking but the side potato salad was really good!

Ploughman's buffet did look good! And for a few dollar extra on top of the main, great option if you are a bigger eater.

Service here was excellent and attentive. I just wish I enjoyed the food a little more.

Maybe I need to come back for dinner and give Skin+Bones another try. The \""Let Us Feed You\"" does sounds good! And of course Sunday Oysters ($1)  and Drink Special!"
2,"\""A grumpy and terse waitress \"" as from what I read in another review is really close to this woman and her wait staff skills. 

Third time experiencing the local spot - definitely the last time. 

First time was solo and they were very busy. Decent burger. 
Second time the server was glaring instead of waiting my table with company. Definitely in a foul mood and visibly shown. 
Third visit, today, incorrect orders. Sarcasm when addressed. 

I'm no fan and won't need to go back here."
2,"Restaurant: Paramount Fine Foods
Cuisine: Middle Eastern
Location: Downtown Toronto
Address: 253 Yonge St
Price Range: $10-15

1: Poor
2: OK
3: Good
4: Very Good
5: Excellent

Food: 3
Service: 1
Ambiance: 1
Overall: 2

Paramount Fine Foods is in heart of Dundas Square. I've passed by this place so many times and it was busy all the time so I decided to check it out. There are seats by the front that's like outside seating. If you like people staring at you while you eat, there is always that option. They serve Appetizers, Sandwiches and Meat Plates.

There were so many different types of dessert but I had no idea what they were. If you didn't catch on yet, I am a newbie with Middle Eastern Food.

They have this Take-Out display window when you first walk into the restaurant that totally caught me off guard. I wasn't sure if we had to wait for someone to seat us or we just had to line up and get our food and sit down like a foodcourt.

Ordered: HUMMUS ($4.99) The Complimentary bread went very well with the Hummus, the hummus comes in this to-go plastic bowl so I am assuming it's easier for people to take home when you don't finish it. Which is most likely the case cause it was huge! The hummus itself had very mild flavor and wasn't too garlicky with a drizzle of olive oil on top.

Ordered: CHICKEN SHAWARMA ($10.99) This is a really big dish. It come with a giant bread on the bottom topped with grilled chicken pieces, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and this yogurt sauce. You are suppose to rip the bread into small pieces and wrap some of the rice and chicken and eat it. This was like the Beef Shawarma Sandwich but opened up. I thought it was just ok, nothing special. Chicken pieces didn't have much flavor and the pickle/tomato pieces were warm..don't know if it was suppose to be like that?

Ordered: BEEF SHAWARMA SANDWICH ($5.99) This is all the beef, lettuce, pickles and white yogurt sauce wrapped in a bread. For the price, it's a decent size and had lots of beef in it. To be honest I think it could have more seasoning (no idea what though) cause it was too bland for me.

So I feel like I can't really tell if it's good/bad Middle Eastern food because I haven't had it very often and don't know much about it. But personally, I didn't really enjoy anything from this restaurant. Maybe I am too used to Beef/Chicken Shawarma I usually pick up from small vendors that are heavily seasoned and sauced. But hey, that's what I enjoy.

Even if I really enjoyed the food, their service completely turned me off from ever visiting this restaurant in the future. Yes, it is a very busy restaurant- but mid way through my meal, I ordered a diet coke. It never comes so I ask again (different person), wait 10 more minute? nothing!! In total I think I asked about 4 times for a damn can of Diet coke and they couldn't deliver. By the time we got our bill, one of them finally tried to give us the stupid diet coke which I didn't even want anymore. AND they gave us the wrong bill which was like $60 when our original bill was $25'ish.

Summary: This is not a place to enjoy a relaxing meal, the tables are crowded and the service is slow. The atmosphere and the service is not worth the tip you have to squeeze out at the end of the meal. If you crave shawarma, I recommend you go to some smaller joint around the corner and it will taste exactly the same (maybe even better)"
2,"Nothing special, the food was average, had the chicken and waffles but after being in Harlem for real and having real chicken and waffles, this place just can't compare. The service was great though, very helpful and very nice."
2,"Started off well with the korean fried chicken, but the latin heat platter was disgusting. Seems like the chef was very confused with all the weird combinations that did not work well. This particular platter was very bland and was clearly experimental. The service was horrendous, as our order was forgotten twice and it took over 20 mins to get our bill. After a 40 mins wait, I was expecting something amazing but was terribly disappointed."
2,"This place was awesome! I think way better than the reviews suggest. The food was creative, original and absolutely delicious!"
2,"I've been to the banh mi boys by spadina and was super excited to try this location out as well (Yonge/eglington). Everything tasted fresh and tasty. I ordered the steam bun with panko crusted tofu (it was very flavourful) as well as the jicama&papaya slaw, I loved the spicy dressing (but if your not into spice, alone would've tasted good too). I can't wait to try the Kalbi beef and grilled chicken next..."
2,"Honestly, they do the regular (royal) milk tea ($4.70) very well. For $0.50 I like adding the milk foam because it has a little saltiness to it and it's super thick and creamy. 

The north York location is great. It's clean and there are 2 communal big tables and many 2-person tables near the back and a nice sofa table in the front by the window. 

They're just like Chatime with an abundant items on their menu, but I think it's the milk foam that gets me coming back every time.

This location is particularly good because it's nice if you wanted to go on a coffee date and/or a small group outing. 

All in all, I like this place a lot. The milk tea is"
2,"Nestled in \""Corktown\"" of downtown Toronto area is Le Petit Dejeuner, a small Belgian Canadian restaurant serving comfort food with lineups regularly outside the door.

Our party of three arrived at 11:15 am and were told it was a 30 to 40 minute wait. Luckily we were seated within 20 minutes. I ordered an earl gray tea (they offer special loose leaf teas) which paired so well with a hot breakfast! 

With any brunch place I recommend getting something sweet off the menu (Belgian waffles are an excellent choice!) paired with something savory - like a crepe or one of their sandwiches. I ordered the Authentic Belgian Waffles - Brussels' Strawberries and chantilly cream which will hit the spot especially if you have a sweet tooth or sweet craving. I paired this with Croque Monsieur Sandwich: ham, swiss & dijon mustard with cheese gratin served with mesclun greens, apple coleslaw and paprika mayonnaise. Delicious.

Would come back again!"
3,"A pretty standard dimsum place, though extra points for serving it all day long!

My friends and I came on a Sunday afternoon and waited around 10 minutes for a table. Food came out pretty quickly. We got some classic dimsum dishes - har gow (4pc), siu mai (4pc), shrimp rice rolls (3pc), black bean shortribs, fried pork dumplings (3pc), bbq pork buns (3pc). Everything was tasty but it didn't seem like anything really stood out over other dimsum places. 

One thing I wouldn't recommend is the mixed vegetables we got off the regular menu. It was ~$13 for a plate of mostly beansprouts and those white oniony things (?) - very little broccoli or snowpeas or any other good stuff.

Most dishes were around $5-6, which seems a little pricey considering some of the dishes (har gow, spareribs) were quite small."
2,"Had the fries box with steak and eggs. It was good but a bit on the dry side. Then I popped the yolks and mixed it in with the box and everything was better. My wife got the veggie fries box and that was very good also. 

I'll have to try the tacos next time."
1,"Rosie in Scarborough, Rosie want burger, Rosie find good reviews of this place on yelp, Rosie adventure over!! 

I was a touch skeptical at the state of emptiness of this place on a Saturday night, but don't let that fool ya, so many noms to be found. 

First, the French fries were like the most perfectest (and if perfectest wasnt a word, it is now) French fries I've ever had. Real potatoes, soft and warm on the inside, a nice gentle crispness to em but still a smooth firm outside. I feel like if I say anymore, it'll be borderline dirty talk, and I usually don't care about fries at burger joints but these were exceptionally awesome thus why I started my review here xD

The burger, arr, this is where it's at cap'n! Meat was definitely fresh, well seasoned, perfect texture, super yums, alongside crisp veggies that tasted real!! (as opposed to some places that you can taste the GMO-ness of their stuff) I had an option between Swiss or cheddar cheese *swoon* and my bacon wasn't crumbly or hidden like most other places, my mouth was pleasantly aware of it, the meltyness of the cheese and the awesome quality of meat. 

*melts into pile of saliva*...*reforms back into human as not to scare roommate who'll be unhappy to find i've melted on the floor...again* 

And they have chipotle mayo!! And whisky BBQ sauce!! These are definitely up there in my favorite sauces evarrr. 

Seatings pretty good, too. 

They have a t.v. and free wifi, and like seriously, who doesn't love free wifi?? 

And it's affordable, as opposed to the other equally awesome burger joints that make my wallet sad and sometimes, my tummy too. Left here not broke and full of yums. 'twas good stuff. 

Definitely would go back if I'm in the area!!"
1,"The drinks are amazing - try the lone wolf! - but the food is very heavy. 
Generous portions for sure, just order with caution, unless you're a meat-a-holic, then go for the platter!"
2,"Nothing better than good ol' comfort food during the cold winter. Even better when you get to sample a variety of items for Winterlicious. 

Came here with a group of 10 so we made reservations ahead of time. Service was fast and attentive. The food was pretty good too. I got the salmon off the Winterlicious menu which was seasoned and blackened perfectly but still remained juicy. The lamb shank option looked and smelled incredible. The meat was fall off the bone and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes. You can never go wrong with mashed potatoes. As for dessert, the carrot cake and creme brûlée are definitely my top choices. Their dessert err on the sweet side, but I'm a sugar fiend so I didn't mind. 

It's a nice rustic setting to get together with friends or to bring a date. Definitely check it out even if it isn't for Winterlicious. You can't go wrong with great food and atmosphere."
1,"Cheap pitchers, tons of seats, inexpensive yet non-offensive food. Oh and many massive TVs. 

Watch stuff here during the playoffs for anything and you'll have a good time.

That's about it."
2,"I had a veggie bentobox there last night. It was a good combo for dinner but the quality was not matched with my expectation. Price was ok, not cheap nor expensive. the services was ok too, but the parking is a problem for this place"
3,"Great atmosphere in this place and awesome service. Small, but in a cozy way. Didn't seem like there were many tables for two except for a barstool-like long table section, but a good amount of tables for 4 or more. There was a miscommunication with the reservations but still got seated right away thanks to our very friendly waitress. 

Prices are reasonable and I love the small plate options. Appetizers are a little small for the price though, but good quality. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food. Nice beer available. Love that they left a container of cheese on the table to put on our pasta ourselves. 

Definitely would go back and suggest others try them out."
2,"This is my most favourite sushi joint in Scarborough! So good in fact I can forgive the fact that it's not AYCE which is my forte. It is a cute, quaint place that seats at most maybe 20 people.

The staff were super friendly. After looking at the menu we decided to order the medium sushi, sashimi, and roll combo (46 pieces, $44.95), firecracker roll ($12.95), and the valentine roll ($10.95) to split between the 5 of us. They gave us teas right after ordering and miso soup to start us off. I think about 15 minutes later they bring us the boat of sushi and wow were we impressed! Presentation was on point. The sushi tasted so fresh and everything was well prepared. My favourite had to be the valentine roll because it had shredded crunchy potato strings on top which gave the roll a little something extra.

The head chef was the one bringing out the orders and he was able to split our bill 5 ways which was nice of him. I recommend this place as the entire dining experience was wonderful and the food was amazing."
3,"Thai Basil is a nice looking restaurant in the heart of the Annex.  The menu is very extensive. However, when it comes to execution, the food is just ordinary, probably below your average Thai food.  

The vegetarian fresh Thai Cold Rolls ($5.95) were disappointing. They were lacking any flavour and were missing the nice accents you usually find, like fresh mint. They came with a thimble-sized serving of dipping sauce.

The Tom Yum soup was very sweet, lacking in heat or other flavours.  It was also expensive at $7.95 for an individual portion.

The green mango salad was actually ripe yellow mango. It was sweet, with sweet sauce. It was missing any brininess, or heat or some crunch.

The Thai Basil Prawns ($12.95) was supposed to be tiger prawns, but were actually quite small. Moreover, there weren't many of them. The basil was not pronounce. The prawns were served in some goopy sauce without much flavour. The dish didn't come with any rice.

The service is hurried and leaves something to be desired."
2,"I used to eat at Spadina Garden when it was on Spadina near College. They never disappoint. Wonderful flavours, friendly, speedy courteous service, unpretentious and well-deserving of its popularity. Try every version of the hot spicy peanut dish that you can (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu). Don't forget to ask for water."
2,I found this stick in my burger and almost chipped my tooth. The pitchers were flat. The staff was nice. Good and drinks sucked.
2,"Love this spot. It has changed hands a lot but I think this iteration is by far the best. I used to only come during the weekend for the club but I've been frequenting more often with work colleagues and there are so many options for seating. You can be intimate with the couches, professional with the tables, casual with the high-tops or large group-networking w the back area. And the food has gotten worlds better!!!  Kudos to the management staff!"
1,"Am I the best person to send on a wild boar chase around the city in the hot pursuit of cured juniper ham (aka Speck)?? Probably not, but I found myself in this very predicament and my nose led me straight into Scheffler's arms after over a dozen frantic calls to various butchers across the city (\""Huh, what's Speck? No idea.\"" was the most common response I got). 

I was able to score the Austro-Italian type prosciutto at a competitive price, which is unsurprising considering Scheffler's boasts the largest selection of prosciutto in the entire city. Here you can also stock up on a variety of cheese, spicy stuffed peppers, grape leaves, fresh pesto and other briny foods like pickled onions, olives and capers.

CUTIE ALERT: Owner Odysseas Gounalakis has owned Scheffler's for 20 years, and first met his wife Sandra while they were both working at St. Lawrence Market. Awww."
2,"I love this cute little sushi restaurant in the East end! It's difficult to find a quality sushi restaurant in scarborough that's open late and has quality food.

The dinner menu is typical for a sushi place but the quality of the food is great and the service is wonderful. The server was so helpful and pleasant. 

This is our new go to sushi place"
2,"This is a great addition to lunch and breakfast options in the neighborhood.  The pricing on par with similar places nearby (Avenue cafe, for example).  The service is friendly, the decor/atmosphere are crisp and clean, and the food is always delicious.  It's awesome that the grilled paninis all come with a bonus balsamic greens side salad  to make a complete lunch.  The carrot cake dessert is amazing and the grain salads are great too.  We have an office in the building  above.  They've done catering for  several of our events and it's always a hit!"
2,"The restaurant on the first floor of this hotel was all it was cracked up to be. Great service with super friendly, knowledgeable staff. The food was spot on, not one thing I would change (except maybe more of it!). The seafood entree was to die (so creative and fresh). I would definitely suggest this to a friend. No problem with a larger party, everyone ate together and enjoyed their meals."
1,"Sayonara, teashop 168, hello gong cha! Wow! That's all I can say. I've always known I was missing out (speaking as a teashop 168 kind of guy) on the full bubble tea experience but this was exactly what I've been saying a bubble tea place should be! The interior is super nice and chic and cozy with an amazing playlist. Customer service is fantastic. The first thing they did was offer us free samples, and naturally I went right for the sample. I got the oolong milk tea that tastes like a cookie with brown sugar on top. I love that you can choose sugar and ice levels and have so many options for toppings (pearls, grass jelly, coconut jelly, red bean etc!) And you don't get charged extra for half sweet (teashop 168!!!! )
Overall the drinks were incredibly yummy, service was fast and very friendly and communicative, and interior was very nice and chic. Our new go-to!"
2,Good but not great.  First time there so i ordered a variety of things.  The hot sauce on the rice balls are spicy but not flavourful.  Just hot.  All similar sauce pretty much on everything.   The fried chicken was pretty good.  Probably will go back and just stick to the 2 piece chicken combo.
2,"Charcuterie was amazing w/ a side of bread.

The bone marrow was buttery goodness.

The goat cavatelli was amazing. Crumbles of goat meat mixed in w/ cavatelli and light melted cheese. Perfect balance of chewy and soft.

The foie gras & pancake was, hands down, THE best thing I ever ate. Two lovely pieces of foie gras on top of a small fluffy pancake. Smothered in blueberry compote & maple syrup and surrounded by Captain Crunch crumble. It had the right balance of sweet & salty. It was SO good, my friend & I came here twice while we visited Toronto... Yes, we came back the very next night just for this pancake!

You MUST come here if visiting Toronto. If you don't, you're definitely missing out. I kid you not."
2,"Fantastic Thai food and great staff - a winning combination! I had the Gaeng Hunglay - pork belly (also available with ox tail) and a ginger curry rub in a clay pot, served with rice. I've never seen it on a menu before and it was recommended so I had to give it a try. I also ordered the Pad Thai. Too much food for sure, but when I go to a new Thai place, I always want to sample a couple of things. Both were prepared simply and were really exceptional. The menu is a little limited - only about 20 items including starters and mains. This is good I think. It means the things that are on the menu are done very well. It's apparent there is a lot of attention paid to the offerings here. 

Speaking of staff, everyone was really friendly and helpful. I sat at the bar, so I saw more of them than I would have had I been at a table. No fewer than 4 people asked me how I enjoyed my meal. They've only been open about a month so enthusiasm is very high. I get the sense that everyone is fairly dedicated to the chef, the concept and the idea that they are bringing authentic and delicious Thai cuisine.

Pai reminds me a lot of Pok Pok - Andy Ricker's incredible top Thai place in Portland Oregon."
2,"Simply the best Indian Food I have ever had. It's all subtlety of taste.

The lamb shank with spinach is something you go back for over and over. In fact they took it off the menu a while ago and received so many complaints from regulars, they will prepare it for you on demand if you ask for it!

Summertime is a real bonus. It has to be _the_ most pleasant patio (more of a garden) in Toronto dining. 

If I had to say something bad it would be that it can get quite noisy on weekends, with large parties. That and the art is a little disturbing. But in a good way."
2,"Amazing, they have a vegan sandwich which is out of this world ! Recommended my co workers and they love the coffee, better than Starbucks !"
2,"Excellent bar, food is good as is the service., its a little small but other than that I can't think of any problems. I had the fish and chips and 
I have to say now that Deep Blue is closed this place has the best fish and chips around, especially handy because I can get a nice pint with it . All their other food looks delicious, but so far every time I've gone there I have had a massive craving for fish and chips.

The only downside I can think of this place is that it doesn't have much seating, its only 1 floor with a few tables and booths and a small counter. I've never been on the back patio but it doesn't look that big, however I have been lucky enough so far that every time I go there is 1 table for two left.

 I find the Old Nick to be just about everything a great bar should be, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because im sure there is somewhere better out there, but only slightly."
2,"Glad I tried this once!! I was expecting some weird Asian fusion thing that leaned more on fusion than Asian, but I was pleasantly surprised.

We tried:
-Kimchi fries: not as great as everyone raves about, but I love fries so I couldn't resist ordering. Huge portion, and I'm pleasantly surprised it came w/pulled pork. Just wish the fries were crispier..ours were soggy and limp.
-Fried chicken bao: prolly my fave!!! Chicken was tender and juicy, perfectly seasoned and fried!
-5 spice pork belly bao: nothing toooooo special, but I always get caught by the pork belly hype haha
-Grilled pork banh mi: bf said this itself was a 4 star banh mi. We liked how BMB stayed true to the Vietnamese banh mi.
-5 spice pork belly banh mi: just ok - the pork belly hype strikes again!

No issues with service (which was pretty limited bc all you do is order and pick up your food - you bus everything else yourself). The girl cashier was nice enough. Worth trying once! Oh yeah and remember the baos are bigger/more filling than expected - I got full off one."
3,"As a semi-regular visitor I REALLY want to like this place more than I do. There are so many good features to the cafe - big space, lots of tables, free wifi, lots of plugs. It should be the perfect place, especially for the many people who like to linger in coffee shops working.

BUT...

There are two BIG issues:
1) the food and coffee are only so, so. Why drench salad in some sickly sweet dressing? Or, slather huge amounts of mayo on your sandwiches? And, as another reviewer notes, a cappuccino and a lattee are not the same thing. Sadly sloppy coffee making. With so many other great coffee shops in the area, there is no room for poor coffee prep and service.
2) but the bigger issue is: the service is consistently TERRIBLE! And unfortunately this isn't just that there is one surly employee, but comes all the way from the top. The owner is incredibly unfriendly and dismissive of customers and most of the other employees follow suit. Many times now they have either overcharged me, forgotten my order, or mixed up my order. And the response to these errors, is more surliness. There seems to be no genuine interest in pleasing their customers, which is fundamentally unacceptable.

I'd suggest customer service training for everyone, starting with the owner."
2,"I loved my experience of Lamesa's take on Filipino food! It's my first go at the cuisine, and the creative fusion angle has resulted in some pretty delicious dishes coming out of their kitchen. Super-crispy pork, tender and delicious garlic rice, and a really inventive take on shrimp and grits were all outstanding. The cauliflower-three-ways side was also very good, and the flan dessert was delightful, with a sprinkling of rice krispies that played the role of contrast to the flan's creamy custard. Overall the food hit it out of the park. I think it's an especially good example of fusion execution, because I didn't really feel like I was eating a different cuisine, but obviously didn't feel like western fare either: it sat--tastily--in between.

The service was also good and very aware of the average Canadian's general lack of familiarity with Filipino food. Everything came out in a timely way and was explained well. Price was pleasantly reasonable: dinner for two sharing a salad, side, two entrees and dessert (plus three drinks) came under $100, which is far less expensive than many other places producing similar quality.

If it's your first time trying Filipino food (or a variation thereof) I definitely recommend Lamesa! It's also just a really good restaurant with a creative menu. I will be returning to try their tasting menu, which seems to be getting a lot of good press."
1,It's okay thai food. I came because someone else commented that it's similar quality that food as the other more well known establishment on Adelaide but found it not to be the case. Service was okay and so was the food . Prices are reasonable and overall I don't see myself returning since I'm so accustomed to better Thai food.
2,"One of my favorite places for fish tacos. Everything was prepared fresh when i ordered and they had it ready for me in just minutes. In addition to their super friendly staff, the atmosphere was positive, the service was top-notch and most importantly, the food was AMAZING. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu. When I'm craving for Mexican food, gourmet gringos will always be the first place I think of!"
2,"recently discovered, totally a fan.  We ordered the pork sopes with fresh pico cream and hot sauce....a little greasy but delish.  Loved being able to see the old ladies making them by hand too.  We also bought some corn tortillas and dried habaneros to make homemade hot sauce.  Will definitively be back to try more.  So far, hands down the best Mexican/Latin American cooking I've had so far in Toronto."
2,Food is great. Came once for brunch once for dinner. This place isn't as packed as it should be. Brunch is definitely fresher / healthier than dinner. The soups were my favourite soups I've ever had. Will go again sometime.
2,"Freshly made, tasty roti made with a smile. 

The location is conveniently close to the lake, where the alternatives for good food are limited. I was pleasantly surprised to find this place. 

This is mostly a take out place with limited indoor and outdoor seating. It looks like it's run by two young guys - one at the cash and the second cooking. They are efficient at their work, friendly and polite. 

The rotis can take some time to be cooked, so be prepared to wait 10-15 min depending on number of take out orders. 

I had the saag paneer and split the portion between dinner and lunch the following day."
1,"Green Mango used to be located just south of Yonge and Bloor many many years ago. Back in those days, this place was truly one of my top picks for quick, inexpensive, and AMAZING food! When they closed, I cried inside. Funnily enough, their old location found itself referenced in two of my recent reviews of other places that are in the same area today. In both cases, I was criticizing those two other restaurants and lamenting that Green Mango wasn't around anymore.

Then I thought to myself; Is there any chance that Green Mango just moved somewhere out of my usual areas? A quick google search found that there were still a few different Restaurants owned by Green Mango and that their owner sticks to working in the Green Mango Express out west.

I was overjoyed and convinced my wife to make a pilgrimage after work to try this place out! I was pleased to find the owner working right up front and more than happy to reminisce about the old days.

I was a tad disappointed that I wasn't able to find my old favorite food choices as they have been updated since. That being said, the food is still really great, the servings are generous and the prices are right! Even though this place is about a 20 minute highway drive away from where we live, my wife still wants to come out again soon. :)

So you might ask why I'm giving this place 4 stars if the food isn't quite as good as it used to be. Well, that's because it would have gotten a 5 if it was! 4 is still bloody good and this place deserves it!"
2,"Waaiiitt hold up.. no one has reviewed this place yet? Sicilian Sidewalk Cafe is probably THE dessert/cafe place in Little Italy. Most people I talk to and mention cafe in Little Italy instantly have an image of this place.

They have a load of fresh cakes and gourmet pastries (including mouth watering waffles and rolled up crepes) and they consistently amaze me with their rich taste. This is definitely a place worth checking out if you're in Little Italy and looking for an espresso with a sweet treat."
2,I wanted to try this place for a really long time since I heard this place is known for their pancakes.  The pancakes were made out of buttermilk and a bluberry sauce compote with whipped cream. One is big enough for two people. The pancakes melt in your mouth. If I come here again I will probably order the pancakes again since I liked it so much. Very spacious restaurnat and packed
1,"Kom Jug is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. They claim to have the best BBQ pork in North America and while I can't corroborate that claim it is pretty good.

It's not the nicest or fanciest places but it is very inexpensive and the portions are large. For a university student such as myself that is a great asset. The food quality is pretty good and besides the aforementioned BBQ pork they also make decent Thai noodles and won ton soup. The General Gao's (or whoever) chicken is also very tasty.

I'd definitely recommend this restaurant. For the price I haven't found a better place in a Chinatown."
2,"Tucked away in a little alley-like street, my boyfriend and I pulled up to this cute little place! Packed at 11pm on a Sunday (the day before a holiday), we were pleasantly surprised to find this pizza place open. The reviews on this place were good enough for me to bookmark them, so I had to check it out. With the place being packed, we couldn't order a pie without waiting forever so we ended up getting 6 slices which equaled a pie. IT WAS SO GOOD! Super cheesey and melty. Good prices. When we pulled off the cops were pulling up to get slices. Will be back here for sure !"
2,"We found this place randomly while searching for late night Japanese food and we were super impressed! We walked in here on a Wednesday night around 11 pm and the place was packed. Loved the atmosphere! The interior reminded me of Izakaya restaurants in Japan. The service was great - they were very friendly. There was a little too much on the menu which made it hard to choose what to order. I recommend the Waygu beef, giant scallop with soy sauce & butter (a little bit too salty but still good), seafood salad (big portion and very tasty - has wasabi dressing), takoyaki (very fresh), Mentai Carbonara udon and Kitsune udon. I will definitely come back here to try the other dishes! Great place to hang out with friends."
2,"Came here at 8:30pm on a Wednesday night, just before they closed at 9pm. I got the chicken pot pie (~$7) and it was so delicious! The pastry is buttery, rich and flaky and the filling is comforting and creamy. I just wished there was more of it because it only took a few bites to devour it. 

I'd come back for the pies once in a while--the food is dynamite--however, the service I got on that particular day wasn't very welcoming. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I walked out, the lady behind the counter only spoke to me when I paid (she asked if it was only the pies that I wanted). No greeting, no \""Can I help you?\"
2,"Delicious dumplings that are truly \""home\"" made. I peeked into the kitchen and you can see the staff making them without using any special equipment, they dont even have professional ovens. Everything we got was delicious. The place is low key and away from the main street."
2,This was my second visit despite reading some not so good reviews! We were a party of six and except for one; we all liked our choices. I ordered battered cod tacos which was simply delicious. The guacamole too was perfect and very freshly made! Our waiter Gustavo was attentive and nice. All our food came together and that was great. I will go there again to try out other dishes.
2,"Great local Bakery with authentic Persian pastries and nuts. I can honestly say that these were the best pistachios and walnuts I have bought. They import most of their products from Iran and overseas. It's a family run place. I had a chance to speak to the owner and he was extremely nice and informative. These guys have been here for the past 20years. I respect the opinion of the previous reviewer, but in my opinion these local places is what we lack in Toronto. You will not get this kind of service and great products at the big cookie cutter stores. The pastries that they have are great. I had a cream puff and a few Persian pastries. They were all good. I'm looking forward to coming here again and trying other stuff that they have."
1,"This is my second visit in a month or so and I think its one of the best South American - Venezuelan food places in the city. It has a great ambiance, friendly and warm staff and of course the food is great. The first time I tried the Pabellon Veggie Arepa which was great value for money as it was flavourful and filling. Today I ordered the Cazon (cod fish) Arepa and Green Plantain Tostones. Really enjoyed the Green Tostones. Nice and crunchy which was complimented well with the sauces that they provided. The Cazon Arepa is good, but the only suggestion is to add some more veggies or greens to it so that its not purely fish that's filled inside the Arepa. Overall, I highly recommend this place. Hopefully this quality is maintained in the future."
1,"Choice espresso coffee here folks!

Delicate crema, deep roasted and full bodied. 
These guys have selected a delightful roast and are super particular about the freshness and feel of the brew.

Great atmosphere, friendly service, home made treats and all at very realistic prices.

Well worth the trip"
2,"Tallboys est réservé aux amoureux et fins connaisseurs de bières. Ici les serveurs vous expliqueront quelle bière est faite pour vous en fonction des saveurs et pays d'importation.

Tallboys is for beer lovers only. Here you come to enjoy a beer (or several) and also to know about its history. The waiter know their stuff and will take the time to sit down and explain to you the whole story behind each beer."
2,"Great fine dining social place. I love the atmosphere, however I found the staff not as pleasant. None the less, the food was great. I tried the Quebec Boileau venison, every time a restaurant has venison I tend to order it as it is rare. It melted in your mouth I loved it. Would order it again. I found the sides to be alright. I also ordered the shaved onion rings on the side. Very different and the horseradish crema dill complimented the dish very well. Would highly recommend it."
2,"Went to Volo with the hubby last Thursday and I loved it!
The have hundreds of beers including local Ontario Craft beers and fancy imports. The service was impeccable and the staff was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their beers.

The was food was incredible. I started with the Pane appetizer; artesian bread with olive oil. I know it doesn't should like much but it was awesome. 

Next I have the Pollo sandwich, which was tender chicken breast, boston lettuce, double smoked bacon, smoked cheddar and caesar mayo.

I will definitely be back."
2,"I really hope those other happy diners are correct. For me, this is the second worse meal I've ever had. The first was over-cooked rice noodles and ketchup, called Pad Thai.
Oh, and it's really loud! Oy"
2,"Hot black is very close to my work so I find myself visiting quite frequently. They actually just celebrated their one year anniversary! Their coffee is great, staff are nice, decor of the store is beautiful, they have almond milk for the lactose folks such as myself, soda water on tap at the milk and sugar station, and their cups are cool looking! Need I say more? Go show them some love! They also have stamp cards so make sure to pick one of those up!"
2,"Love the fact that you can get sorbet here. Really eases the emotional pain that comes with lactose intolerance.

Super tart raspberry sorbet, super rich chocolate sorbet. Special thanks to the staff for helping me pick a flavour combination that would go together (and for offering several samples). 

Portions are huge for the cup size! The smallest size (two scoops) is all you need for dessert. My only problem with this place is that seating is limited."
2,"Owners were friendly! Lechon was definitely pinoy style which is awesome! Food was great as well comparable to homemade cooking! If you are lazy to cook dinner, this is definitely your first destination :)"
1,"Why haven't I tried this place earlier??  It was excellent!  I LOVE that they have all kinds of alternative choices if you don't want fries/chips.  I had the haddock and fried mushrooms, turns out you get mushrooms AND some fries as well. 

The food wasn't too greasy considering it was all fried.  

It comes in a little box with some printed paper.  There's only a couple of seats inside and the patio is quite small.  If you come here in the winter, plan to take it home.    

Price wasn't too bad considering how much food you get."
2,"FULL DISCLAIMER:  I'm a vegetarian!!  I love vegetarian food!  But as you know, some full on vegan/vegetarian restaurants really disappoint me.  Not Fresh!

Fresh was one of the first places I tried in Toronto YEARS ago when I came to visit.  Back on that trip, I was having intense problems with gall stones and stomach aches and wasn't able to enjoy my meal here.  So, on my last night in Toronto, my dad and I decided to celebrate by going and trying it again.

Man this place gets packed!  The tables are so tiny.  You really feel like you're eating on top of your neighbor.  Definitely not a place to have a private conversation.

Servers look as if they are straight out of an American Apparel ad.  Very attractive, hipster type women.

This time around, the food was delish.  Here is what we ordered.

HOT COCO WITH ALMOND MILK.  Yummy.  Let mine cool so it was just warm.  Dad and I shared it as our \""desert\"" before the meal.

FULL ORDER OF FRENCH FRIES:  -1 star for the fact french fries do not come with a burger!  But these fries are great.  Really tasty and a nice treat.  We got ours with some kind of vegan garlic aioli which may be some of the best veganase I have ever had?  It was great.

ONION RINGS - In my mind, these are Fresh's trade mark item.  Their quinoa onion rings are fun, crunchy, and tasty ... albeit a bit greasy sometimes.

LENTIL SOUP:  Cup/bowls of soup are pretty big.  My dad got some lentil soup and thought it was really tasty on a cool day to warm him up.

MUSHROOM BURGER:  For some reason I decided to get the mushroom burger without the mushrooms, even though I love mushrooms.  I just think I wasn't feeling it that day.  I remember vaguely no substitutions which is okay I guess, but whatevs!  Upon putting my burger together it was really messy although tasty.  One of the better veggie burger patties I have had.

BBQ BURGER:  My dad wanted a burger as well (celebration burgers anyone?) so he got the bbq burger, which was even MESSIER than mine.  But he managed to finish it!

Both burgers came with a salad which I actually really enjoyed.

All in all, I liked my second go at Fresh.  When back in Toronto, I will definitely swing by Fresh for some great vegan food!"
3,"*sigh* -- a succinct summary of my experience here. 

I know this place has been hyped up blah blah blah so maybe it was a one-time flop, who's to say really. casual double date, were hanging out up the street - what could go wrong?!
But, something just doesn't add up about this place.

-Don't call it communal eating if you get like, three ribs in an order. We can't even try one each between the four of us. 
-coleslaw arrived like...5mins after we finished everything we had already ordered. Cool.
-The sandwiches are akin to getting a taco's worth of food ....for +$$. Non merci.
-Best of the food = pulled pork sandwich. Worst = smoked catfish roll (tuna salad/school lunch reminiscent)

TLDR: weird system for ordering/serving, contemplating prices while eating with ikea cutlery off plastic plates, one of us left hangry, coming to terms with the fact that i've been spending 2 much time in parkdale."
2,"I've had brunch at the Good Fork a few times. The Nova Scotia Bennie is pretty freaking tasty - and this is coming from someone who rarely likes eggs Benedict. The service on the weekends is chaotic and slow, which seems to be sometimes because the restaurant is busy and sometimes because they could be better organized or use an extra server. The servers I've met have always been friendly, which is not always the case at brunch establishments. The last time I had brunch, my food wasn't very warm and it took a really long time to get our coffee and water. However, the restaurant had a line out the door and it looked like the credit card machine was down.  

Bottom line: there's a line up during weekend brunch. The food is pretty good, but they need more servers."
2,"Our weekday breakfast was pretty good!  Great ambience and fast, very friendly service.  Some brunch items are only offered on weekends and holidays.  The omelette I had was fluffy and tasty.  Their famous home fries were potato chunks in a ketchup-BBQ sauce, good but mine cooled off quickly and became much less desirable.  My wife had a Benny which was good although some items a bit dry (peameal and muffin).  We enjoyed the bottomless cup coffee as they add a hint of cinnamon.  Overall, a very nice restaurant/bar bordering on greatness if food quality improved a bit."
2,"Food and service has gone majorly downhill since ownership switched over. Nothing special here and they really need to clean their espresso machine. Rufino should be fantastic, but you can taste that the machine is dirty and the new staff keep giving me lactose milk when I ask for lactose free or soy."
3,"We passed by this place on the car and got hungry - and decided to have a take-out order of Grill Pork Chop on Rice.   Upon opening the box at the hotel, it was a total disappointment.   The box had a lot of rice and half piece of pork chop less than 50% of my palm (very very small).   There was nothing else in it  (e.g. vegetables) .   Worse, the pork chop tasted foul - like a re-grilled or was going bad.  The quality and quantity were totally unacceptable.   They must known that we were not local and would not go back because it was a take-out.    Avoid this place if you can."
2,"The huge whisk(e)y selection here is definitely a selling point,  but the food is only okay.  Don't go expecting to be wowed. You won't be really disappointed, but you won't be impressed either."
1,"I have to confess I am a pasta monster. I would be happy eating lunch everyday here at Famiglia Baldassarre for the rest of my life. Sadly they only open 4 days a week.

Arrived early before the place was opened on a overcast chilly afternoon. The wait was minimum and we got to order the 2 pasta of the day, a Crudo and Asparagus to share. 

Nothing can replaced the taste, the mouth feel of freshly made pasta. Their menu changed daily so you always in for a treat and wondering what you going to have for lunch today.

The Prosciutto crudo is a steal at the price. Must order! 

Sometime truffle might be available? Truffle is just magical.

Everything tasted so fresh, pure and wholesome. A taste of love and caring prepared by an Italian mamma?

Just go and you find out what you had been missing in your life. Make sure you bring Cash!"
2,"A visit to medieval times is a must when vacationing with kids in Toronto Ontario, Canada.  There is no guess work about menu its the same everytime for everyone.  The storyline is cheesey dinner theater with an action twist.  The food was good and more than enough to eat for most adults.  Be prepared to be interactive.  All in all a nice night out with a special flare."
2,"Excellent food!   Small place tucked away in Etobicoke, Dundas and Kipling area.   Pleasant decor, clean, smiling staff.  The food, no question about it, is EXCELLENT.  Why reasons why I gave a 3 star rating...white wine must be chilled, pop was flat and room temperature.   Staff needs to give input when we order.   We ordered two salads as well as eggplant, grill platter for the table.   Staff should have let us know that we totally over-did the salad as it just kept coming and coming.   Everything we ordered came with salad.   We had to start sending it back to get it packed to go while dining.  The four spreads we got for the appetizer were excellent.  The roasted eggplant and grill platter were excellent as well.  Will definitely go back, hopefully they can work on the staff for a more pleasant dining experience, ask wait staff to remind certain dishes and try and explain what we are getting a bit better. Really glad we found this little gem."
3,"Staff is friendly. The food is a touch on the pricy side but super delicious. As the saying goes \""you get what you pay for\""! I highly recommend this place!"
2,Mediocre poke at best. The wasabi sauce didn't really go well with the recommended toppings. They were generous with the amount of toppings you were given. Size of the bowl was larger than other poke places.
2,"I've been here a few times since my last review, and though I'm still pro Saint, I think there's been a minor taint. 

The prices here are fairly high, excluding their oyster deals, thus the servers must make decent coin. So, like, why so sour? I'm not one to bitch about service on the regular. I'm talking about *four* visits where I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience for coming in to eat, drink, be merry and spend my hard-earned twoonies. . 

Steak, bubbly and Malbecs remain divine. Giant booths still pop my top."
1,"Only tried the margarita for lunch, loved the concept of serving by weight. Would gladly go back, want to go for dinner to try out some of their other pizzas."
3,Customer service is really bad and shawarma barely had any meat. Teach your staff basic manners when dealing with customers such as saying please and thank you.
1,"Delicious, fresh fish and friendly service. Stumbled upon this place using yelp and went back with another friend. We all love it! So reasonable as well."
1,"Italian comfort food!

My friend showed me this place during one of our lunches since we work in the area.  It was great!

I usually get the small plate of pasta for lunch.  It's just enough to fill me and you get alittle piece of italian bread on the side.  It comes to about $4.05 that is without a drink.   The larger plate is generous and I can't finish it. 

They also have a variety of salads you can choose 1-4 types for a combo lunch as well as fresh ciabatta sandwiches that look REALLY good but I haven't tried yet. 

It's a nice little restaurant with plenty of seating as well, a lot of the suit-men go there for lunches and meetings I found lol.  

If you want to fill up on you carbs....come right in! :)"
2,It has been so long that I did not come to this place. Had my quarter chicken as always and the quality of food still the same! Very consistent!
2,"I stopped by Fugo when I saw that they offer mini donuts! The donuts are super light and the decorations are very cute. Flavour wise, the batter has a cakey taste but it's very fluffy. I tried the sprinkles, nutella, and cookies and cream and all were pretty delish. Overall, a cute and yummy snack!"
2,"Pizza is good here--better as takeout than dine in from what I remember.

Today I just got a slice and asked that pepper flakes were added---looks like they forgot 

Good pizza, affordable.  But they do need to refocus on customer service!  Otherwise Dominoes $5 small pizza seems much more welcoming!"
2,"Cute little French spot in Clarence Square! If I didn't have the address, I would totally have missed it - it's nestled in a row of townhouses.

Small, charming and cosy, and with decor and furniture that will make you feel like you're in Paris!

We were fortunate and got seated right away, but others definitely had to wait.  If you can, get a spot by the window!

I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and was really pleased with my meal, and especially with the generous serving of salmon!

They serve coffees of various types and for the tea lovers, they have a box of tisanes (Kusmi of course!)

The staff is French, which adds to the atmosphere.

There was only one person waiting on tables and the same gent did the drinks, so service was a tad slow, and the server forgot our pain au chocolat.  That said, I found the spot charming and if ever I'm in the King and Spadina area, I'd consider it again!"
2,"Wandered into Toca for some absolutely delicious cocktails. 

I started off with a \""Eve's Evening\"" - Vodka, roasted pineapple liquor, bitters, cherry Heering and nutmeg. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Beautifully presented. 

My date tried one called \""Good Date\"" (hyuk hyuk) which was Canadian club, date and black pepper liquor with orange zest. Definitely a man drink but he seemed to enjoy it!

At Toca you can try some \""mini bites\"
2,"Yay! My first post and many more to come - I'm a foodie, believe me, my stomach growls each time I look at food pictures on my phone. Enough about me, let's provide you with the 411 on Patois:

Chinese & Caribbean cuisine all under 1 roof? Hells yeah! We were a group of 5 and we sat at the bar because no reservations were available until 9:15pm (suggest you make reservations - we were there on Friday at approx 6:15pm). Once we sat down, we looked around and the restaurant looked clean, organized, great music (can talk to your friends without yelling), neatly displayed bottles of liquor, and attentive staff! 

FOOD FOOD FOOD:
1) Jamaican Patty Double Down: $7 10/10 
- heard that this was a must-try, so we ordered it. Picture this: 2 strips of bacon combined with sriracha & cheese fondue sandwiched between 2 jamaican patties. Sound gross? Maybe, as I'm not a fan of Sriracha or bacon, BUT IT WAS DELICIOUS. Before you order anything, please do yourself a favour after a hard day at work, school, appointment etc and order this first. Our server practically told us we will regret just ordering one because she loves it and this appetizer is the size of a men's wallet - small (we ordered another one and our server was like \""I told you so!) 

2) Chinese \""Pineapple\"" Bun Burger $15.50 9/10 
- Pineapple buns, burgers put together? Heaven! This was a good mix of sweet and savoury and I was really surprised it blended in so well. Imagine this: 2 beef patties, with oyster sauce and Mayo inside a cut-opened pineapple bun. Side? Hickory sticks & pickled cucumbers. 

3) Juicy Jerk Chicken  $19 Full order 10/10
- I don't have jerk chicken often, but this to me was the best dish served with habanero sauce. My friends said they have had better, but this was still pretty good to them. This is sharable by the way - good portion size

4) Jamaican Oxtail $18 8.5/10
- Meat was pretty tender that it fell off the bone! This was served with 3 bok choy, Coconut Rice (YAY Carbs), and chicharron, Bacon. I enjoyed this dish too, but I thought the portion size was small - you might have to order something else. 

Summary?
Based on my ratings, you can guess I enjoyed the food right? This is a place I would definitely go back to for all the dishes I have tried. I won't be stupid next time and I will book ahead of time (don't make my mistake :) ). Aside from the food, the staff were attentive in filling our glasses with water, checking on us several times for food and drinks, and our plates were cleared in a good amount of time. Would I recommend you try it? Y-E-S!"
1,"There are lots of options at the Village by the Grange food court, but Manpuku and Gallery Sushi are the only two sit-down restaurants of which I am aware.  From the outside it looks like the seating area in Manpuku is tiny, but when we entered we discovered an upper level with more tables.  

The menu is mostly in Japanese, or English renditions of Japanese, and not very descriptive.  Luckily, they provide pictures of the food, so you can take an educated guess at what you're ordering.  The waitress was also very happy to answer our 457 questions about the food options so that we could decide what to order.

My rice with beef was larger and more filling than expected, especially for the low low price (around $5).  For slightly more you can make your meal a combo and add a couple of appetizers.  A few people at my table ordered the Takosen - something I had never heard of before my experience at Manpuku - with their meals.  (As described in other reviews, Takosen is Takoyaki served between two shrimp rice crackers.)  The waitress warned us that it would take a while (this just means it wouldn't be served instantly) because it was made fresh once ordered.  It was well worth the wait!  I dare you to try it!

If you're adventurous and like good value for your dollar, Manpuku is a great place to dine."
2,"Food was absolutely stellar, even the wings which we only got as an appetizer were delicious. I chose the fried chicken dinner with the mash and wow, it was more than I expected. Even the funnel cake at the end was a delight. Waiter was super nice too. 

Portions are more than great for the price as well. This is one place that I definitely want to check out again and a place that I would recommend to anyone. Worth a visit!"
3,"I ordered the Halibut along with chips and was pretty damn satisfied. 
The halibut was great, average among other fish and chip joints I've been too, but the fries stood out.

A little on the pricey side for fish and chips with the halibut being $13.99.

Staff was super nice and very helpful so that's always a plus!"
2,"I checked out this place while stuck in toronto for 5 hours (transit time!). They have a nice kinda private patio and simple modern seating space inside. I had a drink, a vegetarian glutenfree pizza and coffee. All was agreeable. For me the key point, and the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars, is that I'm gluten intolerant and they had gluten free pizza crust and that the taste and the texture was very very satisfying :) to top it off, my server was particularly kind and patient with all my customization requirements. So if I'm stock in Toronto during transit time and craving pizza, i know where to go :)"
2,"We ordered seafood risotto and the potato gnocci as well as the pizza with salami.
The food was pretty good- but not outstanding as I hoped being one of Toronto Life's Best New restaurant of 2012

I like more excitement in my dishes!

The decor is cute- kinda looks like a nice little French place...that serves Italian 

The servers were very nice!"
2,Went for brunch. Ordered Sapporo breakfast. Very good taste and environment! Drink is also good.
2,We really Love this place! Friendly service and fresh food! Best coffee in the area  :-)
2,"Biggest burger I ever saw. Candied bacon and smoked Gouda were a hit. 
Pro tip: don't sit by the railings. Lots of people begging for drinks and money. 
Preeminent food critic Dean Maltby make the classic mistake of adding poutine to his burger.  Eyes are bigger than his belly. 

PS. He also ordered a litre of beer and tried to get his wife to finish it. \""That's too much beer.\"" he said."
2,Came up on it as we left the parking garage before we went to the museum. Food was good and staff was attentive. Would definitely come back!
1,"Went here yesterday for the fourth time and ordered some of their delicious wings! So good!! Staff is always awesome and courteous and I always have a great experience here whether I'm with people or alone. Their sandwiches are also good, and I tried the mousse dessert - addicting haha! Went in a few days later after the first time just to grab it!! ^.^

Also found it way better priced and more reasonable portion sizes than other vegan restaurants selling the same type of stuff."
2,"Kids loved the Fried Rice. Fought over it. 
Szechuan Beef was good, not outstanding, not too spicy.
Honey Garlic Wings - Moist and tasty.
Will order again."
1,"Ahhhhh.... With an engulfing whiff of the scrumptious and intoxicating aromas as I first stepped foot inside Banjara, I had an inkling that it was going to be as good as I had heard. 

   Word of mouth took me to this wonderful establishment at the corner of Bloor and Crawford (just west of Christie Pits park and a step from my door) and it lived up to it's reputation. You can take my word-of-mouth to heart; delicious and well priced dishes, including both meat and veggie delights! 

   Recently, a South Indian Cuisine restaurant opened right next door called Madras Masala, inevitably by the owners of Banjara and I can not wait to try it next! Look for the Madras review coming soon!"
2,"One of my favorite Vegan spots.  Love the sweet potato mash and collard greens as sides on all the dishes. Have had almost all the options and there isn't a single one I wont have again. All so good!  The Mac n Cheese they serve is amazing, as well and a unChicken n Waffles. UnChicken Wrap is sooo tasty! The service is always friendly and quick. Great spot close by! Will visit soon again."
1,"I found this place on Yelp and was surprised by its high rating that I had to come here for lunch to see for myself! 

Finding the restaurant was a bit difficult as it is located in the corner of a strip with Indian, Filipino, and Chinese food. 

The menu prices have gone up a bit from the prices that I saw on the Yelp photos but regardless, it was still reasonable. We ordered the roll combo $9.95 and sushi and tempura combo $13.95. The rolls were decent but I wished the rice had a stronger rice vinegar flavour.

The service was impeccable as the waitress made sure our cups of tea were always full and came multiple times to refill for us. Also, the waitress was very polite in her greeting when we came as well as when we left. 

Miscellaneous comment that I want to add is that the washroom is very clean; in fact, it is probably the best washroom I've been to at a sushi restaurant."
2,"Not what it used to be. We decided to give this restaurant a visit since it's always been a winner in the past. Unfortunately it has gone downhill. We shared an appetizer which was a trio of dips with nacho chips and pita bread. The bread was not grilled and stale. The dips were bland. 
I ordered a kale salad with cranberries and a lemon dressing. I opted to add salmon to the salad. The lemon taste was non existent and the salmon was drenched in a goop of miso or  teriyaki.
My husband ordered Granma' s meatloaf which I believe is an original menu item. It was always good in the past but not this time. They use to have the best garlic mash but not anymore.  My husband was very disappointed in the taste and said it was not how he remembered it.
We ordered dessert thinking that will at least be good. Nope, it wasn't to be. Pumpkin cheesecake with a tasteless pumpkin puree.
We were considering taking our boys here since they would love to see some of the hockey memorabilia. Think we will give it a pass. Sad to see this guaranteed good meal restaurant go down.  Needs a reno from tattered booth seats to scratches on wood bathroom stall. I guess Wayne is more invested in his winery and not this restaurant anymore. Perhaps he should visit and either revamp or take his name off the place.
The stars are for the polite server and prompt service.  Although the place was pretty empty since it wasn't game night."
1,"This place is a must go .
Authentic , excellent ambiance , steaks are succulent and cooked to order  .
Sea food as good as steaks .
Wine menu covers all tastes . 
Hosts were excellent  . 
Whenever i m in Toronto i will first go there . 
Just a great place to dine in . Chapeau .

Amer"
2,"Great spot to hang out and have a few drinks after the game. Went here after seeing the Argos play and ordered some beer, calamari and beef nachos. The spot is ideal but the reason why it's a 3 and not a 4 is because the food is just average. The nachos were lacking cheese and when we asked for more salsa/sour cream twice, they somehow forgot. No biggie.

I'd come back just to grab some beers though."
2,"Only Canada can have a  French-English pun for a restaurant name....faux real.  

Anyway, this place has an excellent selection of microbrews:
Beer = 5 stars
Food = 3 stars
Service = 3 stars

The BEER selection is really quite good including some house-made options.  I'm not really sure where these microbrewery batches are produced by they do some rather interesting ones.  I really do like the large and extensive list of beers on tap.  Pretty much something for every taste.  

The FOOD selection and offerings were just a bit disappointing.  I had a shepherd's pie which really failed in the presentation department.  It sounded so good in the menu description: lamb and veggies cooked with coffee porter and topped with smoked cheddar.  It looked like someone had laid oily slices of melted process cheese all over the top of the dish.  The underwhelming cheese just dominated the flavors, and it could have been mystery meet instead of lamb.   My friend wasn't all that impressed with his offering either.  Portions are pretty generous, although I would happily traded some extra food for a little more quality.  

The SERVICE was just weird.  Despite being a very calm night, the server/bartender/(maybe he was cooking in back too) was very harried.  What was super frustrating though for 2 Americans new to the Toronto beer scene was that he basically just refused to make recommendations or engage in telling us about the beers.  That's tough when they're all new to you.  

Thankfully, the beer was good.  I'll give the dinner a try again and update my review....otherwise I'll be sticking to drinks here.  

An UPDATE: I find the hostess staff here obnoxious!  On subsequent visits, they've been so incredibly difficult.  Especially when seating a group.  They made tons of undeserved snarky comments and just acting like we were ruining their day by arriving with a group of 10, for which we had called ahead even.  I'm sorry that we're trying to give you our business.  So, don't come here with a group.

FYI: it's a basement restaurant, so little weird for the atmosphere."
2,"Waited around 30 mins even though the wait time they told us was 45 mins. (ridiculous) but whatever we wanted to see what the hype was.

The break down: 
Too friggin loud! Holy crap...talk about not being able to unwind or hear the person in front of me. Couldn't even hear the waitress! What the heck...I don't care much about music but it was excruciatingly loud..I got a really bad headache and the ambiance really affected my meal.

We ordered the bean dip (really good)
Beef cheek taco
Pork taco
Chicken taco
Cod taco

For some reason, the flavours/mix of the toppings on the tacos just did not work well with us...not saying they're bad..just saying the flavours did not work for us. They may work for you but we didn't feel as though the flavours really had a 'flow' or 'mix' together well.

Overall, come here if you want to give it a try..."
2,I love the feel of this place. It's so open and nice. The brunch is done really well - with probably the best mimosas ever!! Really nice place to even go alone and enjoy a glass of wine and read a book. Awesome wine list too.
1,"Outstanding!!!!!!!!!
The group of 17 traveling from Philadelphia to toronto visited this great place. Most of us born in US but of Polish decent, wanted to try this Polish restaurant. 
I, an experience restaurant manager , know what a great management can do to be on the top. 
We visited on saturday at 3 Pm. The place was packed solid. The service made it so easy to sit us at two tables and suggested that we would not even think about being separated once the first dish hits the table. Indeeeeedddddd.
The soups were fantastic. The liver dish and schnitzel was one of the best I ever had. The presentation and taste. 
I ended up trying 6 different plates because all of us were telling others \"" you have to try this and that, its great, \"" I felt bed we had no room for desert, because the size of each plate was huge. 
At the end came our bill and we were shocked to pay ONLY 294 for 17 of us. 
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH."
2,"my take out food was delicious.  you can never go wrong with the ham and cheese avacado crepe.  its the best I've ever had.  Im a frequent here, I've had the avacado salad, the nicoise salad, as well as a few of the sandwiches incl the vegetarian club, ALL FREAKING incredible.

staff is friendly as well."
3,"This cheesecake definitely lives up the hype.  I just really love how light and fluffy, and sponge-like this cake is. It's not the typical cheesecake! It's japanese style cheesecake. I can definitely taste the cream cheese, but it is not very rich like american cheesecake. I waited in line outside for about 40 minutes on a Saturday evening for my cake. They have a limit of one cheesecake per person, so that the line moves steadily. I also tried their green tea matcha cheesecake, which has red bean on the bottom of the cake. It is considerably smaller than their signature original flavour cheesecake, and for the same price (10 bucks). Both are very tasty. But I wish it wasn't so pricey for one cake..."
1,"Went here yesterday for the fourth time and ordered some of their delicious wings! So good!! Staff is always awesome and courteous and I always have a great experience here whether I'm with people or alone. Their sandwiches are also good, and I tried the mousse dessert - addicting haha! Went in a few days later after the first time just to grab it!! ^.^

Also found it way better priced and more reasonable portion sizes than other vegan restaurants selling the same type of stuff."
2,Everything was so tasty...we actually ordered a second Skillet Corn!  Korean Cowboy serves exactly what their name suggests. ..a perfect East meets West fusion experience!  Definitely coming back!
1,"As many other reviewers mention, this place does nothing particularly exceptional, but they generally hit the basic mark. A fairly good bear selection and well priced as well.

Food is run-of-the-mill pub food that doesn't really elevate anything nor have a unique touch to it, but they don't seem to mess anything up either.

Lots of seating and they pack out for Tuesday trivia nights. If you go, prepared to be humbled as there's some Mensa-level participants there."
3,"This place is for tourists, not for local.
This place is overpriced, the service is quite good tho.
The quality of the food is not even fitting the price.
Will never come again."
2,"I thought that the food quality was very poor.  The fish egg roll wrapped in nori was not wrapped, and the fish soup was only the fatty brown part of salmon (no other type of seafood) and too salty.  As well, I asked what the BBQ fish was and was told they did not know.  It was a sardine fish with head cut in half.  Worse,  my friend and I ordered a couple of things when we sat down but the staff (because there were 4 young Japanese men serving us) kept trying to take them away.

There's no al a carte menu.  As well, you have a 90 minute maximum and are told on the menu that you'll have to pay for anything you do not eat.  Considering there are no prices given b/c they only do all-you-eat, who knows what they would charge.

The decor was very nice though and if you are going out with a big eater, this might be a great choice.

I went on a Saturday afternoon in November at 12:30 pm, and there was no line up.  By 1 pm, there was a line up of about 10 people."
2,I love love love this place.  It's small enough for it to be intimate and big enough to celebrate with a group of friends.  So nice that I almost don't want anybody to know about it = )
1,"By being more of an anachronism than a restaurant, Sugo brings back the tastes, portions and service of years long past. 

This small little shop on Bloor delivers big by offering generous portions (the veal sandwich came with TWO patties and the spaghetti was good for two meals). The friendly staff gave us our food on time as promised, joked around without an inkling of pretension - a quality that is hard to find in Toronto these days. Prices were more than fair considering the quanity and quality of what you get.

Sugo is must go in Toronto."
2,"The keg rocks! Dinner was exactly as I expected... amazing! Our server was top notch, we would love to steal her! Lol!! The keg size cosmos were a great compliment to dinner!"
1,"I am neither a vegan or vegetarian, but due to dietary restrictions I *do* need to eat gluten-free. 

It seems like their menu has contracted recently, though I quite like the fact that gluten-free items are very clearly labelled.  Gluten-free offerings include most dishes and one dessert, though the waiter indicated that with some modifications (essentially subbing wheat noodles for rice noodles) virtually any item other than desserts and avocado tacos could be made gluten-free. They use potato starch in place of flour where possible which means items like soups, which are usually off-limits for Celiacs at restaurants, are safe.

The food was freshly prepared and very tasty.  Portion sizes were quite large for the price and service was both prompt and friendly. 

All in all the experience was fantastic.  I'd honestly give it 5 stars were it not for the questionable backing of the chain itself, but the operators of this specific franchise were extremely helpful and friendly... but I guess that's how they get 'ya."
3,"Well Joey, it looks like the third time is the charm afterall! 

 My previous visits had proven disasterous  what with inept/bimbo-fied service and near incontinental occurances of Gerard Depardieu-like proportions, so it was with much trepidation that I broached my third visit to Joey's. 

It certainly helps that I had the  pleasure of joining the Divine Miss Chris P and Yelper extrordinaire Karl \""Kool Kid\"" R for some good ole noshery. Our plush surroundings of the spaciously leatheriffic booth was also a boon to our good spirits.  Hmmm, did they spike the air in here with oxygenated Spanish Fly or Ecstacy because everybody was looking muy caliente at Joey tonite including our stunningly efficient brunette server. Purrrrrrrrrrr.

We were in for some great eats as the charming Karl R ordered the Hi-Rise burger with skinny frites and the lovely Chris P had what looked like delicious mashed potato blintzes with grilled salmon.  I stuck to my fave Joey meal of the Baja fish tacos which is 3 palatable sized soft white corn shells filled with the perfect combination of fried fish/shrimps and tart guacamole and tomatoes with the spicy sauce on the side..just the way I like.

Along with our savoury dishes our discussions revolved around such erudite matters as strippers, birth order and why I am so attracted to hot gay men? I'm looking at you Tom Ford!

In the end it was a three way of major Yelptitude but before you get any lecherous ideas no, it was was not an ackward tangle of limbs and gonads, more like a lot of forking around fighting over the last tantalizing mouthfuls of dessert which in this case was an incredible rendition of Joey's apple pie with a sinful dollup of maple ice cream that melted languorously over the delicately buttery patisserie crust and crumbles of cinnamon and moist baked apples...some definite pie porn if you will.

 Kudos to Chris P and her geniousness for discovering a closer restroom and thus solving my previous bathroom grievance of trekking for miles while practicing your Kegels.  So it looks like you won't be needing the Depends to visit Joey's afterall!

Joey I tip my hat to you. Your sexy atmosphere, down to earth menu and restrooms within reach, have made me a happy girl.
I would give 5 stars had the child version of Joey Lawrence himself did a little tap dance number for me, but alas youtube can only provide me with this for my moment of zen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPRV7aoag4   \""Whoa!\""
fbWhdgqT2FcDtkpsqRj3tg,""A little sad that these are not all around the city and I always have to find them at events. Please open up a store so I can get my fix! 

I love how these taste. It is a fried piece of dough with various types of toppings. My personal favourite is the cinnamon, lemon and sugar one. I tried the hazelnut one and that one is great for Nutella lovers 

4 stars because my purchased jumped up to about $9.50 with the addition of water. Felt a little pricey, but this is a classic!"
1,"Eating cooked seafood from a plastic bag using your hands has become the latest trend in Toronto's food scenery for a while now. And since it's so hard to get in to The Captain's Boil, I decided to give this one a try.

Among its variety of seafood-inspired dishes, I really liked the King Crab Leg served with the Leviathan Sauce. The crab legs were surprisingly easy to break apart, although crackers or scissors are provided for the tougher shells. For smaller things I recommend the Cuba Shrimp paired with the Kraken Sauce -- their signature garlicky house sauce.  

ALSO I strongly recommend you go there during lunch time, and buy the deal from Groupon! You can get one of their sizzling plates. For only around 8 bucks (I think?), you have a choice of beef, chicken, shrimp, which comes with a side of mixed seafood boil bag (2 shrimps, 3 sausages, 2 mussels, and sweet corn). Very decent deal for all you workers and students out there, way better than food court eh?

Overall what I like about The Boil Bar is that there is zero formality. This whole dump-it-on-the-table-and-share gives a lot casual touch on the whole dining experience, and makes eating out together much more fun!"
3,"It's not worth the money. Everything do taste same like curry. We tried all vegetarian dishes. Service was good but not great. The food wasn't flavourful. Everything was just cold. Nothing piping hot. The dipping sauces were too watery. The dishes were too sweet like channa masala, raita,saag. Tasteless food. Gulab jamun in buffet are generally served soft and warm but here it was hard and cold. We personally didn't find anything exciting to eat. The deserts tasted like powdered. I wouldn't recommend if you are really looking for Authentic Indian taste and flavours."
2,"The positives; 
Chicken was tasty, 
Restaurant is nice

The negatives; 
Half of the staff act like they have been sentenced to community service in nandos! One or two really enthusiastic people around but most of them seemed fed up being there. Pretty sure the girl at the cash was trying to impale her pen in the touch screen every time she prodded it
 
Portions are tiny! Unless you are a small young rabbit avoid the regular size Caesar salad. My gf ordered this & I'm not lying when I say you'd probably get more salad on a Big Mac!!

My fries were cold. I brought then up to the desk & they replaced them with marginally warmer ones at which point I just ate them. 

All in all I probably wont go back but I must admit the chicken was good albeit a smallish portion."
2,"Wow while reading all these reviews I have to say it's been a totally difference experience. It's Sunday the bar on the patio is half packed and I just ordered the most amazing nachos ever. (chicken and chili ..) . Give it a try , the indoor patio is available in any weather ."
2,"Had the small beef soup, noodles were medium thick, it was good. I would go to again."
2,"Got food poisoning here. Ordered rare steak which when properly cooked is safe to eat. Regular at other Keg locations, usually a reliable steak. This location is dirty and poorly managed not impressed."
2,"Got away eh?  I'd let the line out on this one...

I'm gonna keep this one brief since it's hard to go on about disappointment.

The place has a nice ambiance to it and it's bright and inviting.  The staff are also friendly and courteous, but it just doesn't really amount to the disappointment really.

Being a place that specializes in Fish and Chips, you'd think that they would have a good handle on it.  To my bitter disappointment these were hardly up to par to some fish fry shacks I've visited.  I opted for the halibut and chips - and I'll give you that the fries were decent.  The fish however was a completely different matter.  The batter was thick, bland and with no character at all.  And it seemed the fish was way overcooked to the point where it was a bit tough and dry.  So part of me questions whether it's the quality of the halibut (and possibly the other selections) before the fry.  Because let's face it, you can deep fry almost anything and it'll most likely be a tasty mess.

In the end, I'm glad I got to try it out, but they'll be the ones fishing for me if they want my business again."
3,"Went here today. It was a beautiful afternoon and we happened to be in the East end of town. The patio was in the sun and I've been wanting to try out Ceili for awhile! I was sure my boyfriend would love it- bangers and mash and beer are right up his ally. 

Service was good. 

Food was disappointing. I thought the mussels sounded good, and ordered some of their homemade bread and butter to sop up the broth. The bread was very dry and did not seem fresh at all. The mussels didn't taste the freshest and the broth was waaaay too salty. I only ate about half of my meal (very rare for me). Even my boyfriend- who is very easy to please generally, thought it was sub par (although the mashed potatoes were tasty!) the banger was too chewy and tough. All this and one Guinness set me back $54 (tip included). Will not return."
2,"We have been visiting few burger places in search of the best veggie burger. After Hero and Acme, it was time to Harvey's. I was excited and it was worthy, as the burger end up to be really delicious. We enjoyed it with fries and ice tea. For a Friday winter night it was pretty quiet, as it was occupied mostly with singles and few couples. I know why they were all quiet, as the burger was too good to have a conversation. Ha!

The other time when we were there my excitement was cooled down when we got to putting the burger together. Older Chinese man was serving us and he was so fast and so unclear to me that when he asked something I took a moment to reply and he already replied himself and poured something on my burger which I didn't want. It was a turnoff and one of us took that up to the manager and we were served another burger. All was good at the end, but totally unnecessary in my opinion.

I am not sure if the veggie burger at Harvey's is the best, but we will find ourselves going back there as the food was really good, though the place itself and service not so much."
1,"3 things I like and don't like

1. Price: Quite possibly the best bang for your buck Chinese food in North York. You can get anything from eggplant with rice to ho fun noodles for a low price ($8-$10) and the portions are massive, especially for noodle dishes.

2. Variety: Not only can you get staple lunch and dinner dishes, there's also a breakfast menu and tea menu. In addition to all of those, there's also the whole BBQ section and feasts for large groups. You can come here for a relaxing cup of tea, a quick and filling lunch, or a large group gathering.

3. Service: The most disappointing thing about this restaurant. Been here several times and each time it takes at least 5 minutes to get a table, even when the restaurant is not even close to full capacity. Even when you do manage to be seated, they at times ask you to move to a different table a few minutes later for no particular reason at all."
2,"The food here is good but the service is extremely bad. I found a white plastic-like piece of something in my dosa which I spent about good five minutes experimenting with my guest to see whether it was harmful or not. While I concluded that it was most probably ok to finish eating the food and that what I found is something that is not non-veg (as i'm a vegetarian!), I was still disturbed by the experience. Consequently, I called the waitress and informed about it. She took the white plastic-like object from me and had a discussion with the mangers and owner right in front of me (everyone made eye contact and/or starred at me while having a discussion, lol!). Waitress came back and said that I could have gotten another dosa but since I finished eating what I ordered i'm no longer eligible AND  that it won't be taken off the bill bc they are already doing their anniversary promotion and so they cannot offer another discount. I was really upset because a) this whole thing interrupted my dinner, b) interrupted my dinner date with my guest, c) caused a lot of stress d) wasted a whole lot of my time, e) and to make matters worse they offered me a deal which apparently had expired because I continued to eat the dosa - this is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from a restaurant manager!! and I was extremely shocked to hear it come from a restaurant that charges a hefty price!

I went straight to the owner, David, and brought up the issue. He repeated just what the waitress had told me which is that since I finished the food, they cannot offer me anything. I told him how much i'm disappointed and upset by their customer service. I raised all of the above points as well as the fact that all complaints should be handled directly by the manager and the least that could've been done is give an apology instead of arguing with the customer with a ridiculous point!! What was evident from the conversation is that the managers and especially the owner have no customer service skills and they have no interest in looking after customer satisfaction. David was simply using a cookie-cutter approach to the problem instead of looking at it in an individual basis and focusing on customer satisfaction. He said that his team of staff figured out that the white plastic-like object was in fact a piece of flattened dry rice. What they failed to do is inform that to me so that at least it would have put me at ease instead leaving me to feel that i could've potentially eaten something harmful. What was really interesting in the conversation with David is that no where in our conversation he took the ownership for their mistake which includes but not limited to: a) sending a waitress to address complaint instead of  a manger, b) not informing that the object is in fact rice and not something harmful, c) not offering apology, d) offering a deal that apparently expired because i finished eating the last bit of dosa i had in my plate, e) telling me that because they were doing a promotion for their anniversary, they cannot offer another discount for me (which was a very foolish thing to say!).. etc. 

If they want business, they need to start looking after their customers!!! This is a very shocking and disturbing experience esp since this came directly from the owner! I promoted their anniversary deal by forwarding their email to friends and colleagues - I will surely be informing all of them of this experience. at least at the end of my complaint, he should've offered a statement of apology or something to make up for the stress and disturbance caused but instead he was all about wining the argument.

There's a lot for David and his management staff to learn re: customer service! Perhaps go dine at Fabbrica or Joey or auberge du pommier or even cheaper restaurants like pickle barrel to really learn what customer service is all about!"
2,"As others have said, Reposado serves up tequila far superior to any of the crap you remember puking up in college. Instead of making a pained, sour pickle face as you down it, you feel as dignified as a diplomat while you sip a selection of premium tequilas hand-selected for you by a knowledgeable and personable staff.

Our bartender, Eddie, attended to us with such care and customization I felt like I was meeting with a mortgage consultant or wedding planner. He quizzed us on our favourite types of alcohol and price points to finally suggest the perfect flight for us to sample - Milagro brand tequila. 

A flight is a series of one ounce servings of a brand of tequila (they have tons of them) in each of the three stages of tequila's lifespan - blanco (white, or virgin), reposado (\""rested\"") and añejo (\""aged\""). The lot is served on a tray with Sangrita, a sort of spicy tomato shot that you can sip like a chaser in between swills of tequila. Don't be fooled by the tequila shot glasses though - this isn't the Madison and you're not meant to down these in one swallow. Sit back and enjoy as you work your way from brisk blanco to smooth añejo. 

Reposado also has excellent margaritas, including classic (reposado margarita), blood orange (a house favourite) and mango. Try them all. Also be sure to try some of their excellent beers - they have Delerium Tremens and apparently, according to my beer aficionado friends, this is quite the find. Savour it!"
2,"Be honest, my first experience with Neo was just so so. The  service was cold, the matcha Adzuki cake roll was dry and had not much matcha flavour, Shingen cake roll had a strange burned taste... so it turned me off to return. 

But wait,... I was meeting a friend in St Lawrence Market and decided to give Neo another try.  This time, the Ontario Strawberry roll was very fresh and tasty, the Orange Dark Chocolate roll wss made with very rich dark choco and match very well with orange. Both rolls were moist. The matcha latte was fine as well and wish it would be smoother in texture. Service was friendly and quick.

Then, I went back to try the Pistachio and Raspberry roll; the pistachio cream was very rich in flavour and went so well with the raspberry. It was my favourite among all the flavours I have tried. The roll was moist as well.

I would go back for their tasty roll cake."
2,Don't let the prices scare you away from this gourmet pizza! Their flavour combos are genius and there is genuine care put into each dish - you can tell. Calamari was especially pleasing as an appetizer.
2,"Went here for the first time, I am very pleased that at nearly closing time their fish still tastes fresh. I did the BYOB and got shoyu salmon with crabmeat and seaweed.  Tbh, I would give this place 5 stars for the service and taste. Portion wise, the salmon was alright, I had more crabmeat and seaweed. I'd still come back cos it's the closest poke place to me, hopefully they do a rewards thing and be more generous with their fish."
2,"I went here with a friend last night, and our entire meal was great! We got the three course price fixe for $30 and a pasta special. The salad on the price fixe menu was nothing to write home about, but the scallops, pasta special, and panna cotta were delicious!  Every plate was clean when they came to pick them up. I should mention that my friend is Italian and he was quite impressed.
As for ambience, the restaurant is small, so if it were packed you might be uncomfortably close to the table next to you, but we continually remarked that it was so nice to be able to hear the person at our table and carry on a conversation.  I was actually pretty shocked that it wasn't busier at 8pm on a Friday night, but that worked out well for us!"
1,"I came here for a work brunch and ordered their ultimate breakfast sandwich with a side of fries ($12). 

While it was  delicious, the bread was slightly burnt which made it difficult to eat. I ended up scraping off the top layer of bread, which made it much more enjoyable. Had they used soft bread, it would have been slightly healthier and much more tasty! The fries were good, not overly stiff, which I quite enjoyed. 

The patio was stunning! It brought back memories of the secret garden, my favourite childhood movie.

Overall it's a beautiful spot with decent comfort food at an affordable price. I'd be open to going back, but likely wouldn't crave their food..."
2,"Oooooooh damn, schoolbus Russ back at it again with one of them slick reviews. Let's get it on.

*play \""Rica Y Apretadita - El General Con Anayca while reading this review*

Alright wussup y'all I just crept up in the game to inform you about this dope spot.

So I walk in, 3 deep. Clique full of real riders. We know what the deal is. Seating was limited, but very nice and intimate for your boy. Wussup Waitress, gimme them Cecina tacos. 3 of em (that's how many you get in one order). Lemme start with a margarita, cause ya boy hella thirsty from running game all day. I'll also get chips and guac because as always, I stick to my guns and keep it real (playa Del Carmen what up).

Them margaritas? To die for. Me and my hitta appreciated them. Well needed. Well salted. Them chips? Lemme tell you bout them chips. They were made with love, and were crunchy. You know ya boy appreciated them.

Them 3 tacos? Hold up. Lemme tell you, I ate 2 of them so fast I had a stomach ache. I had to lay out, I couldn't get bodied. In this economy? Nah fam. I finished the last taco and moved to my dessert. The brownie? I can't say nuttin about it. U gotta experience it yourself. Moneyyyyyyyy.

Alright yo. I'm writing to you from the table I will soon collect the check at. Payin my duckets folks. I hope you saucy, and keep it real. Pimp don't simp.

- Skoolbus Russ"
2,"We stopped by Wingburger for a quick lunch. The fried chicken was juicy and delicious. We had the choice of getting it sauced or seasoned, we opted for the latter & really enjoyed it. The fries were made fresh to order, and were good with a splash of malt vinegar. The owner was very friendly & personable. Great place for a quick bite if you're in the neighbourhood!"
2,"Have often gone in here before a Blue Jays game, which is when it is often extremely crowded and typically has a line to get in.

Have only ever sat at the bar, so don't know what the table service is like, but the bartenders have always been friendly and attentive without being too pushy. Often they've told me about beer deals they have which saved me money.

The food is typical pub food, but I've always loved the ancho chipotle club wrap. And the fries are excellent. Fluffy and spiced perfectly, not some bland, cheap tasting frozen junk."
2,"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING Service was so friendly and opening, food was exceptional! The pasta wasn't too saucy, but so incredibly rich. I got the bacon carbonara and arugula salad, while my BF got the pollo Toscano pizza and the Alfredo pasta (secret menu item)  could not recommend this place enough. There was a small mix up with our reservation times and they were so apologetic about it we weren't even upset !!! They made sure we were happy!!"
1,"This is like Sushi Express but just fresher. The items are prepared on the day they're being sold so it tasted fresher than those you can buy at Metro. The servers are very friendly. 

The prices are also very reasonable. Try the green tea sugar free drink and you'll be awake despite of the carb rush. 

This inside grandma's mall - Cloverdale and normally not packed."
2,"Went here after a walk wanted to see if it was better then the \""other\"" burger place down the street. Well it wasn't, it's a big burger yes but even with all the topping bacon cheese onion rings mushrooms and more it still seems like it's missing something. The burger did fall apart into 6pieces after the first bite lol don't know how to feel about that."
1,"Me and my sister decided to stop here when we broke away from a family vacation in Toronto. We walked in and immediately liked the atmosphere the place had. We decided to sit at the bar and were very quickly greeted by a very friendly bartender (who we later found is named Stacey). My sister tried to order the brown, which was unfortunately sold out - which I take to mean it's pretty good - so we decided on the amber. It was delicious and we both finished very quickly. I followed up with a jack and Coke and my sister a vodka tonic. Both were made with a very good balance of liquor and Coke/tonic. The prices are affordable and the service and drinks were fantastic! Would absolutely recommend."
3,"the location was a search! The place was located within an unfinished condominium. I had to ask couple of people where it was. Other than that, the store was cute, the walls were filled with colourful drawings. And the employees were friendly and explaining the ingredients within their famous ice cream. 

The pricing and the amount you get is disappointing. The price for a small is around 6$ and the large is up to 9$. Not including topics. Which is quite ridiculous for a ice cream. 6$ for the amount me and my friend got was super small. Based on the picture from the menu, we only got half of the amount. 

The ice cream was good, but definitely not worth the price. In my opinion, It was good to try but won't be back again. :/"
3,Definitely has the ole tyme vibe. But I don't think random odds and ends shops would have sold stuff for that price.
3,"Came here because I saw that they had soup dumplings here, I am on a quest to find good soup dumplings in Toronto (not successful so far, oh how I miss Shanghai Cafe in NYC for this!). Anyways the decor is similar to Spring Rolls, they are so similar that my husband wondered if this was a Spring Roll chain. The food here is slightly better than Spring Rolls,  edible, but nothing noteworthy for sure. 

The soup dumplings were NOT good, meat is too grainy and not enough filling. Filling lacks flavor as well. Prices were kind of high for the caliber of food and for its location."
2,"Friday 28 July - 9pm.Deliberately embarrassed by waiters and manager because i couldn't read the menu. I'm old. i forgot my glasses. I selected STRATEGO because i can see the pictures of the military men, The waiter asked me to pick a beverage from the printed menu and I said I couldn't and could he please help . he wouldn't. He said 'its all on the menu' I said again 'I dont have my glasses' so he said i'll leave the menu, and I shrugged - It wouldn't help. My date saw me shrug and wondered? and I said 'bad waiter'. Seconds later another face appeared and at first I thought 'good a better waiter', But NO; it was the manager who without doing ANY INVESTIGATION whatsoever himself just insisted I leave. Other tables were looking. It was super embarrassing. My date will probably never talk to me again. I already feel old and now even more useless."
2,Beautiful patio made the evening. Got the florentine calzone; was good but a lot smaller than expected. Girlfriend got the chicken avocado pizza which was great
1,I had been to this location several times before the renovation and was disappointed every time. Just went for the first time since the renos and was actually surprised at how much it's been cleaned up. The space is much more open and comfortable. Tv's at every booth are a nice touch for sports fans. The menu has expanded considerably and improved tenfold. Choices are great for a night of watching the game with friends and best of all - mini pitchers of beer for under 10$! Good upgrade for the block.
2,Been here quite a few times.  Garlic sauce is really good as is the hot sauce.  The quality of the chicken isn't that great sometimes.  Once i found a small piece of plastic in my shawarma. Trying to convince my coworkers to try Tummy Time down the street instead.
2,"The Beer Bistro is by far the friendliest place to go for a couple of pints if you work in the Yonge and King area. The first time I set foot into the place was over 4 years back. I ordered a bottle of Liberty Ale, and was instantly hooked. I have tried numerous other beers over the years, but I am a true believer in love at first sight, so I always go back to my favorite. Great mix of beer nuts available, and the best time to go is before the evening rush."
2,Cute little place within the financial district. I wish it was a stand alone store because it feels a little weird that it's a part of a food court in the PATH. One step into the place transforms you into Paris. It's a really cute place for a quick bite as there arent too many tables around. They have a nice selection of tea and pastries. Prices are average for French style bakeries/cafes downtown.
2,"Went for brunch, price is comparable to other brunch places $14-$18. Give this five stars for the atmosphere and the view. View is to die for, you can see all of downtown core and cn tower. Although it was -30 outside that it hurts to walk around, the sun and floor to ceiling windows on a nice sunny Saturday made it feel like summer all over again. The servers were also super nice and allowed us to chat and soak up the sun for another hr after we paid.

Would definitely want to come back at night for the night view and in the summer for patio weather and we can see this view outside."
3,"I've eaten at this diner numerous times (I work across the street and have been eagerly awaiting something to replace stem.) While this location is better than the ossington offshoot, it's still not great. Burgers are over-priced to be served a la carte and although I order medium rare every time I visit - I've yet to see a slighty pink burger. The breakfast (pretty hard to fuck up) tasted like a campfire as everything was grilled. Soggy bread, mini French fries, burnt bacon and raw eggs.

On a separate occasion, I ordered the stem burger (fearful of receiving a disasterous breakfast again) and the egg was also under-cooked. I'm not usually picky but raw egg white dripping from an overcooked burger is hardly appealing.

Conversely, pulled pork poutine is to die for."
1,"Perfect Okonomiyaki ya for T.O.  The Okonomiyaki was good, inexpensive, and they have fast service.  Too bad the atmosphere is not nicer - it's a bit \""fast food\"" like.  Also, seems silly to charge extra for bonito flakes and seaweed.  However, they do what they do well - very tasty okonomiyaki."
2,"Clean Diner style interior, great look. Kid friendly menu.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Went for Brunch, had the hash and pork. Portions were good, food was rather bland. Will try it again for dinner."
2,I have confirmation that it is reopening in 2 weeks with a new owner! Mark who was the executive chef at Greenwood Smokehouse BBQ is taking it over. I saw him there today! So excited!
1,"Levetto opened a location in Chinatown recently and I was sceptical at the beginning. Italian food in Chinatown doesn't make much sense, until you remember that there are a ton of new condo buildings going up in the area.

In terms of food, it's fast-casual pizza and pasta. Nothing amazing but good quality food at reasonable prices. My go-to is the pasta carbonara which is easily enough for two meals, and it's pretty good value at $12.50. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza we ordered (the Soppressata). While the ingredients were of very high quality, I didn't find it had much flavour to it. Next time I'll try the Peking duck pizza, as I did pick the blandest pizza on offer after all.

While this Levetto is new and the staff are clearly still learning the ropes (slow service, meals coming out 15 minutes apart) the value and overall quality of the food earns them four stars in my books. Once they get the hang of things, I can see this place being one of the best places to eat in the area for delicious, good quality food at very reasonable prices."
2,"I am giving it a five star because they don't have a 4.75

I have had many meals here because I live locally.  Always reliable for good service (attractive staff) and very good food, if not always excellent.  Reliable to bring business clients. Tables are close but seems to work.

The new renovation since April looks terrific. Upscale.

For such a major city Toronto does not have a lot of 4 pr 5 star restaurants. O&B helps.

Good luck with the business.

John C."
2,"For some reason I had no idea this this place even existed... I guess I've been living under a rock or something. 
Anyway, I stumbled across this gastro Hall, as it were, and decided to opt for the burger based on all the positive reviews. I can safely say that it is definitely a legit Burger! Patties are made from scratch and grilled fresh, served on a perfectly Toasted Bun. It's the perfect balance between a moist Patty and a crispy finish..
Burgers come with fries and you can opt for cheesy truffle fries instead. After reading all the reviews I decided to try it. In all honesty the first couple of bites were delicious, but then I found that the rest of the fries were too dry for my liking. A little disappointing, but overall I'd still give it a strong 4/5. 

This Assembly Hall is a definitely legit place to check out, I can't wait to come back and try more of the deliciousness!"
2,"Not impressed with the service and wait time. This is not a group friendly place. We were a party of 7 and had to wait for over an hour for a table and we eventually got one, our server was not very helpful; she'd rather refer us to the chalk board downstairs than tell us what the daily specials were, forgot milk and cream for our coffee, didn't remember who'd ordered what, was hard to get hold of and in the end handed me the bill to figure out how it had to be split, which I didn't appreciate at all. We wouldn't go back."
1,Great place! The spice on the chicken shawarma is amazing! Daily cheap specials are the icing on the cake
2,"Maybe it's because I can get to and from the office within a 5 minute stumble, or maybe it's because I can't get away from the smell of their fries, but this place gets it right."
2,"Succulent Souvlaki:
Turns out that one of the best souvlaki dinners in Toronto isn't in Greektown on The Danforth but in the legendary burger joint Burger Shack.
Chicken souvlaki is charbroiled and served with choices of Greek salad, Fries and or rice. The portions are very generous and the chicken is tender and juicy!"
2,"They do have good food for a chain and the service is good. I also like the patio outside. You can easily have a business meeting at this place but you either have to arrive early, like 11:50 or make a reservation"
2,"The service was 5 star, the product I received this time only 3 stars. I say this because I went in  for cannoli, left with macarons,This was only because they where out of the cannoli, the worker offered to make me some fresh(note to self;take that offer next time) but I was hungry and wanted satisfaction then and there. So I got the macarons 2 chocolate fudge,2 chocolate,2 Canadian maple and 2 roasted coconut. Yesterday the others had a flakey consistency like what I've usually experienced the roasted coconut was a bit harder then the others. I put a few away to test a theory on the freshness of the macrons while the others hardened a tad in the fridge over night, the roasted coconut was as hard as a rock. In closing if you visit and have the chance to get a cannoli made fresh or already made take it. And if you are going to try the Macrons, the chocolate fudge is best the rest are ok but the roasted coconut just isn't up to the par set by the others."
1,"Hands down, the best steak I've ever had. I can't wait to come back here. I would recommend going with people who like their steak cooked the same way as you since the steaks are quite large, so it would be ideal to get a couple and share.  I ended up having to eat a 12 oz ribeye myself, in addition to the Caesar salad (shared but still a large portion!) and some side orders (mashed potatoes and duck fat fries).  My fiancé had an 18oz strip loin. The steaks were so flavourful and smooth as butter! The various salts and dipping sauces were also really delicious although the steak had such good flavor with just some sea salt that you don't really need those extras.  The mashed potatoes were delicious, but I could have lived without the fries which were a little on the soggy side for my liking.  The service is good here, the staff know just when to approach the table and when to let you enjoy your meal. The take home muffins were great as was the little brownie bite at the end, although I was way too stuffed to really enjoy it... 
Given the size of the portions here, I really don't think the prices are astronomical when compared to other expensive steakhouses downtown (Barberian's, Ruth's Chris, Mortons) and really the steaks are far better at Jacobs than the other places I've tried!"
2,Tried Tom Tom with Brie and.. Something with Tuna.  I visited this place 5 years ago and today. Nothing changed!! So good  and she is a very kind person!
2,Had lunch. Friendly service and healthy choices on the menu. Satisfied with my smoked salmon sandwich. You can substitute fries with salad.  One thing I highly recommend is their fresh cranberry lemonade. Very refreshing and not too sweet and it is yummy!
2,"Location: Yorkville Ave, Toronto,
Items Ordered: White Wine Sangria ($10) + Bruchetta ($8) + Deep Fried Zucchini+Artichokes with Roasted Red Pepper Aioli and Lemon Lime Aioli ($13) + Orecchiette with Rapini, Spicy Italian Sausage, Fontina, Parmigiano, Garlic, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil ($20) + Fusilli with Chicken + Mushrooms in a light Cream Sauce ($20) and much more that I did not try. 

I have been here a few times including this past Saturday and I just realized how spacious the resto actually is. Usually my company and I grab a seat on the patio and never venture inside. However, this time my party of 6 wanted to sit indoors. 
We were seated right away, without reservations, which was great because our hunger had grown to an unattractive size at 8:30pm on a Saturday.
  
We got a sexy little booth on the lower level and admired the rustic ambiance. 
I started off with a white wine sangria- nothing special, wouldn't order it again. After a long wait, or maybe what seemed much longer because we were ravenous, our deep fried zucchini and artichokes arrived along with the bruschetta. I found the deep fried apps to be too salty. The bruschetta had an overpowering garlicky taste and not much else. Then came the bread for the table, AFTER the apps. The free bread was delicious and warm. 

For dinner I had orecchiette with rapini, spicy Italian sausage, fontina, parmigiano, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil. Sounds good right? It was, although one of the ravenous ladies ordered the same dish with a splash of tomato sauce, which I found was the way to go, as it added a punch of more flavour. However, once I tried my neighbour's dish; chicken and mushrooms fusilli in a light cream sauce, I wanted that! I picked at my neighbour's food for the rest of the evening. 

Overall, the portion sizes were huge, service was good, not great and the waiter was cute. 

I am wanting to try their brunch deal which is on now; $35/pp for a bottle of Italian bubbly and a 2 course meal. Stay tuned..."
1,"Cheap, fresh and fast is how I like my lunch, and CJ doesn't disappoint.  They're friendly and helpful, and there is a great variety of sushi, mostly maki rolls.  My staple is salmon/avocado rolls with veggie dumplings, and wakami salad, and a complimentary miso soup.  Sometimes I'll get the veggie noodles or the tempura shrimp maki rolls.  They also cater !"
2,We went here on a recommendation. The cappuccino was excellent. A croissant sandwich and an avocado and cheese sandwich were also crispy and tasty. Don't forget the chocolate soufflé for dessert. Even if it is breakfast.
2,"I was never a big fan of Thai food so when my friend booker this place for my Bday I was like \""Ehhhh, let's give it a try!\"" We went there around 6pm on Saturday and it was already packed. The place was so different with all Thai place I had been too. When the food came, I was like Wow!!! Everything was so delicious! The portion was enough to fill up. The sauce was so creamy and rich. All staffs were so nice and friendly. I talked to a guy at the bar and found out that they actually bought a lot of spice and ingredients from Thailand, which costs them more but it's completely worth it. 

I would definitely highly recommend this place to everybody."
3,"Not a vegetarian but this place really appeals to me.  Rotating menu, excellent kale salad.  Lot of tasty items on the menu.  Only complaint; expensive.  I feel it's overpriced, I would go more often if more affordable."
2,"One of my new favourite spots! Although the wait was long - there were a few large parties that took longer than expected to wrap up), the overall experience made up for it! 

Tino the owner was very apologetic for the wait, and gave a glass of bubbly to sip on! Tess the bartender is amazing at creating and whipping up cocktails, and provide amazing service. The food also didn't disappoint. I love that you can pick and choose what meats and cheese you'd like, rather than a pre-set charcuterie board. Calamari was delicious, as well as the arancini."
3,"Had a great meal here, will definitely go back. Service was great, we were in no rush and enjoyed having the opportunity to have a leisurely dinner with friends. That seems to be the kind of service they provide so it meshed well.

Atmosphere is upscale casual, nicely decorated place with a modern but cozy feel. Biggest plus was that it was such a nice temperature in the restaurant, I hate walking into an ice box and freezing for the duration of the meal, using the napkin like a blanket...

Our waiter was enthusiastic, good humoured and did a good job helping us decide what we wanted, or at least validating that it was a good choice.

They gave us some bread and olives to get us going which were very tasty. We ordered the muscles to start, I drank the remaining broth like soup, it was so good (they give you spoons for this, some restaurants don't). 

Also had the rabbit ragu (YUM), swordfish (wonderfully tender), the seafood pasta (really good) and the sterling. The meat was underdone for my husband's liking (rare) and they happily took it back and gave it a bit more time on the grill - it came back a perfect medium rare. 

The wine was a bit pricy if you are familiar with how much the bottles are at the LCBO but that's typical at restaurants. We bought two bottles at $40 ea. For the whole meal, including two bottles of wine it came out to about $260 before tip."
2,"I was having midnight cravings and decided to visit the shop. Very few selections during the last hour of opening but that's expected so I decided desserts. I'm very allergic to nuts and told the staff.  Although I've read their menu soooo many times, I've chosen a dessert w nuts. Thankfully, June stopped me before I headed out the door w the deadly dessert. He told me the maple tart is a very new desert which isn't updated in the menu booklet. He kindly offered a refund but I chosen two fruit roll instead. Although its a fruit swiss roll, you can taste mostly mango but the roll wasn't too sweet. The staff were very helpful and kind even before closing. I would definitely come again for my night munchies!! ^^"
2,"The food was amazing, this place is for someone that loves food full of flavour!  I am not impressed often, but the dishes blew me away. I can't wait to come back and try the chefs sample menu.

I have never had Filipino food before, I asked the server for recommendations and he basically built my dinner experience. He described every dish and explained which ingredients made the flavour unique!"
2,Terrible service time in takeout. Takes 45 mins for them to put a cake in a box with minimal icing added. Would not recommend getting a cake from here. Not worth the wait.
3,"I went looking for a place to eat at 10:30pm on Bloor and the hotel manager said my choices were pizza, fried chicken, or this place.  So I went here and had the beef Shwarma.  It was neither terrible nor good...it was quite plain and obviously low quality, but for the price...and the time...it was fine.  I don't think I'd go back again unless I was stuck in the same late-night situation.  And even then I suspect that I'll find something better in the area even for late nights eats after I've been around a while longer.  So if you need a cheap bite to eat then this might be good for you, but if you'll pay for quality then this isn't for you.  Even the baklava tastes kinda weird."
1,Great breakfast spot.. Right in the heart of greek town.. I go there almost every Sunday never been disappointed... Prices are fair.. But what I love the most is the atmosphere really feels like you're in an old school diner
2,"I haven't yet had the opportunity to eat in at this place but we got take out once after a long day of moving, and it was fan-tastic. And the folks organizing the pick up food were pleasant and speedy. I look forward to a chance to eat in the restaurant."
3,"Jacobs & Co. is simply fantastic. Their selection of dry aged steaks from all around the world is remarkable. I went with two buddies and we ordered 3 different steaks and had them cut so we can share. All 3 had different yet exquisite taste. I'm very picky when it comes to steak and usually don't enjoy ordering one outside of my house, but Jacobs and Co. does it right!

Service is amazing, the rest of the menu was great too. Duck Fat Fries, made at your table Caesar salad, all great. It's quite expensive, but when looking to indulge and spend some money, you can't go wrong with Jacob and Co."
2,"Popped in for a bite, atmosphere is great, service is great! I had the tomato soup and Margherita flat bread both exceptionally good. The flatbread is a little small so don't make it a main meal but it is like nothing else  I have had. So fresh and simple and tasty!!
Must stop by this place. The people watching of those shopping in the mall is nice too haha!"
3,"Ordered over $75 worth of food, wasn't worth it. Poutine tasted weird, burgers were mostly bread and watery vegetables with a small patty. Wouldn't recommend."
2,"The sandwich here is pretty good. The special with all the fixings is the way to go. Though I think theres too much mustard for me and not enough of their house sauce. The best part is the crackling. It just makes it that much better. 

Service is friendly and quick. They didn't hesitate to explain how the menu works and the sandwiches. Its a pretty tiny place inside, so its good for a quick bite. Don't loiter so that others can get seats as well."
2,"I general love Brazilian Steakhouses, this place is one of the better once as well.
Tip 1: first round of meat, grab a small piece of each, second round grab a bigger pieces of the stuff you liked, final round should be a big piece of the nights winner :)
Tip 2 : leave some space for the the delicious pineapple.

Enjoy!"
2,"Weird customer service, or shall I say lack of.
Went to the Yorkville location. 
I've had the smoothie bowls, smoothies and coffee, all were pretty good save for the \""Proud\"" bowl as it had lots of ice filler. 
Also had a rice based bowl with chicken which was unremarkable but sufficient.
The reason I won't go back anymore is because they have strange personalities.
They have 'dairy' (milk), coconut and almond milk, but don't have cream available for the coffee which is standard everywhere. Nor do they have cinnamon..(fine, but still) anyhow I asked on different occasions with different staff members if they could suggest to management to have cream as I drink a lot of coffee and would go more often if they supplied cream; they froze like robots and ignored me. When I persisted they looked stressed and fluffed me off with a 'yeah okay' type of mumble. The normal thing to do would be to say \""sure I'll pass your suggestion on\"
2,"For a place that looks pretty fancy I was disappointed by the service and decor here. I came here with my hubby on a Monday afternoon for lunch. I had ordered the sliders and asked for there to be no sauce, or toppings of any kind due to my allergies. But when my order came it came with cheese. So I had to send it back. When the food came back the sliders tasted decent. They weren't the most delicious or the worst I'd had, just in the middle. The sliders also came with a little tiny side of fries. It was really only about 5 pieces of french fries. I had to laugh as it looked a bit ridiculous. Hubby had the mini yorkies and thai nachos. He said his food tasted good but the mini yorkies deflated. He said the nachos were messy. But I think nachos are messy by nature anyway as you eat them with your hands. So I'm not sure what hubby means by that. LOL.

Anyway service was kind of mediocre too. The waitress serving us was very quiet and it could be hard to hear her over the music. The other wait staff who brought our food was okay. I'm not sure I would eat here again. Most of the good reviews seem to be for dinner time meals. We probably would have been better off at Elephant & Castle across the street."
2,"Roti Palace has the best roti flavour in town in my opinion.  The restaurant appears to be a bit squalid from the outside and the inside is not much better.  Dated pictures of the Caribbean hang haphazardly on the wall and the floors seem to have a fine layer of perma-dirt.  However, it seems to be very authentic West Indian food and delicious to boot!  I am not sure what spices or ingredients are that they use in the roti sauce, but it is what I would imagine crack to be to a crack head, extremely addictive!  The boneless chicken roti is my personal favourite which has a delicious potato filling; however, the goat is also very tasty and you may feel pretty exotic eating goat.  The rice and peas are also scrumptious. Again I am not able to discern what flavour makes it so mouth-watering.  The service is usually speedy for take out and they are pleasant enough, although at times they may appear disgruntled. 

I recommend the Caribbean Roti Palace."
2,"My husband and I have been coming to Nome Izakya for a few years now... we don;t come nearly as often as we'd like but it all started with their Tuesday and Wed. night  bucka  shuck oysters ...... from trying the buck a shuck, and all the other items on the menu, we were HOOKED!!!! 

he japa sliders .  sashimi salad , and beef ribs are so so so good !!!!  

the owner is a wonderful man, he is always attentive of customers and the servers are on POINT////....the girls work hard, pay attention, are kind to customers, great service overall every time. 
-- the special lately was Salmon don which was SO OOOOOO delicious, we also love the sushi rolls ! 

Nome is one of the best kept secrets in the city... it's also walkable from our house! bonus !"
2,"How cute is Kalendar?? Everytime I walk by (almost every day), I feel some sort of invisible force urging me to go inside. It's just one of those inviting, cozy places, and also has prime patio space which is usually packed in the summer. 

This is a place where you could enjoy a romantic date inside,  bring your mom for brunch on the patio, or sip coffee by yourself and read the paper at a window seat. Their menu is very appealing with choices grouped off (naans, \""scrolls\"
1," The service was friendly and efficient and the prices are pretty reasonable for what I consider to be a classy but casual place. Kalendar doesn't disappoint!"""
1,"I will most likely not come back. 

Their lunch specials are cheap and the portions are huge but the food is not very good. Really bland especially for Hakka food. 

If I was really craving some Hakka and was downtown I might go here but I would probably not be satisfied."
2,When I lived in Toronto this was one of my fav places to go for a quick meal after work or a yummy desert date with my bf. if you come here please try the F.B.I it's so yummy I wish I could replicate this desert!
2,"The cheesecake is to die for! Only downside is the huge line up to actually buy your cheesecake. We waited for about 30 minutes and you are only allowed one order per person. Also it is cash only, no plastic"
2,"Popped in for lunch.  Big tasty burger!  No relish in house seemed odd.  I've had wings and watched the game here before. Awesome \""Canadian\"" bar"
2,"Two & a half stars.

Maybe I'm missing something here because most of the previous reviewers had so many great things to say about this place.  There isn't an iota of a wow factor in this resto whatsoever.  Frankly I found it to be kinda grungy.  My arms kept sliding on the clear plastic covers tacked on to the tables.  This spot looks like a cheap restaurant makeover place.  Even the glassware is kinda grungy.  You know how glasses get to look after they been through the industrial dishwashers one too many times.  This is totally Five Doors North which made me wish I should have gone a few doors further north and hit up Zucca instead.  

Hooked up with my sista meatatarian, the groovy Shari M. and we were hunkering down for a celebrataory birthday evening and thought this place would hit the spot, especially after reading the glowing reviews.  We ordered some plates to share.  Grilled sardines.  Pizzetta.  Sausages.  Some rolled up prosciutto thing that they brought literally seconds after ordering.  They must make them in advance and keep them in the fridge.  This meant the prosciutto was really well chilled which ultimately means you just can't taste it and it raised the chewy factor even more so.  

Shari ordered a Cosmo and her reaction was to tell me not to order my usual Cosmo cocktail because she could tell by the taste they were using really cheap booze.  Cocktails and wine by the glass is on par with restos such as the Hoof, Splendido, Enoteca....yet were miles apart in terms of quality, quantity and stemware.  I notice these things and even more so when all I keep thinking is about my arms sliding around the greasy plastic table covers.  

Five Doors North.  Two & a Half Doors for me."
2,"Good tasty fresh food, great service at Dizengoff. Very nice restaurant; pity that people don't know about this place which is in an industrial area. The Manager Danny is a very pleasant guy."
3,Have this first time after walking by a few times. This is not a real true Japanese ramen place you would expect. Lot more room than a normal ramen place which is the only highlight. The soup is okay but not great. The portion is small both the ramen and meat. A normal man will need extra noodle portion. However the price is about 10 -15% more than the other place around. I probably won't come back for all the above reason and few others just walking distance away.
2,"Fantastic food, service and ambience!

This past Saturday, I celebrated my birthday at Scaramouche Restaurant. We were seated near the windows that had a nice view of the city. They started us off with a basket of bread and a complimentary amuse-bouche, which was a smoked salmon puff pastry. We each ordered a glass of Murphy-Goode Cabernet Sauvignon ($15) which went perfectly with our meals.

For our appetizers, we ordered: 

Yellowfin Tuna Tartare ($24) - The tuna was light in flavour and not overpowered by the soy marinade. The radish, jicama, coriander and finger lime added a refreshing touch. The avocado purée and crème frâiche were both light and creamy with distinct flavours. And the squid ink tempura crumbs balanced the dish out with a delicious, crunchy texture. 

Cavatelli ($22) - The appetizer was a part of their specials of the day which included cavatelli pasta and an assortment of vegetables. The pasta and vegetables were cooked al dente and had light and tangy flavours from the sauce. I personally enjoyed this dish while Kevin wasn't a fan because there were too many vegetables and no meat (haha).

For our mains, we ordered:

Lamb ($48) - My bf ordered the lamb and I was able to try some. The lamb was delicious and juicy, with quite a strong curry flavour on the crust. 

Grilled Filet Mignon ($49) - I ordered the Filet Mignon cooked medium rare which came out pre-sliced into three pieces. The steak was cooked beautifully and was very tender. The Bordelaise sauce was smooth and rich in flavour, which went perfectly with the steak.

Since we had movie reservations later on in the night, we decided to go for dessert near the theatre. Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience at Scaramouche, from their fantastic service to their aesthetically pleasing dishes. I would love to go back again and try other delicious menu items!"
2,"The sushi and hot food were REALLY GOOD!!! But kinda sucks that they only gave 2 packets of soy sauce for a $70+ take out order. LOL. It would have been more enjoyable not to worry about running out of soy sauce.. will def come back for the good food though!!!

Edit: They fixed the issue with the soy sauce packets yasss! They started delivering too so that's a plus!"
3,"Came here on a Sunday at around 11. They gave us an estimated wait time of an hour so we went back to the condo (an 8 minute walk). They texted us when the table was ready and told us we had 5 minutes to bring the whole group back or we would lose our spot. I find the 5 minute time rule a little extensive.  In the summer, waiting an hour in nice weather isn't so bad but in the winter.... where would you even wait? There entry way fits about 6 people standing... there are no coffee shops or seating area outside. They should at least do 10-15 minute return rule.  The food was good. After having been to Mildred's temple kitchen, the pancakes at school were quite heavy and filling.  I also ordered the grilled cheese French toast. It was very a very heavy meal. Smothered in cheese. A little too much cheese. The flavour was good.  The prices for their dishes was a little pricey. In my opinion they should have smaller portions and lower their prices. Many of us couldn't finish our meals."
1,My favourite pizza place in midtown! Great prices for great pizza! And the cookies are YUM!
2,"Thai is one of my favourite cuisine and Pai has become one of my favourite restaurants as well. I have been here for dinner and have ordered lunch from them a couple of times. 

I love their curry dishes the most. I ordered chicken and beef before and have been very happy with my choices.  I also tried their pad thai and although it was good, I cannot say that it was out of the ordinary from other places so I would go back to their curry choices.  

My only complaints is the service, be it at the restaurant or delivery. Although they are friendly, service is quite slow. One time they missed a dish when my office ordered from them.  Their lunch menu  is also much more limited than their dinner menu."
1,"Really thankful for Yelp for helping me find this place! I got the chicken fries for $6.99 and it was enormous! They give a generous amount of chicken and fries. The chicken was tender and extremely delicious! The hot sauce isn't too spicy and you can tell that it is homemade. Coming back to try everything else!

The owner is really nice and talked with my friends and I, telling us about the restaurant, food, ingredients. He offered us 3 sample sizes of the chicken while waiting (the samples were big). He talked about his life. It was refreshing having such outstanding customer service. He even let us try the garlic sauce and try the beef.

I highly recommend anyone on the fence of trying out the place, to give it a try! The place deserves a 5 star rating. It is very clean. Will be going back!"
2,"Place was somewhat busy, but it was an assembly line.  The meat was luke warm, lots of salad, no like it was before with the previous owners.  I was a regular going there twice to 3 times a week.  Now it's only once a month if that.  There are better places to go to close by. i.e. CBC building underground."
1,"I didn't think I liked Hakka Indian cuisine that much, but this place made me change my mind. The food was delicious. It's reasonably priced too."
2,"This is our first time to Sushi Legend. When we got here around 6:30pm (made reservations) on a long weekend it wasn't packed. We got our seats immediately. 

Ordering food on a tablet was easy. Like that the sashimi pieces were in order of increments of 1 piece. 

The sashimi was very good. The beef tataki and beef short ribs were yummy.  Love the okras and mushrooms- were cooked with butter and garlic. 

The beef roll wrapped in green onion was dry and seemed over cooked. 

Soft drinks were included. The usual soft drink choices. 

The only thing we didn't like were the sushi rolls. They were on the bland side."
2,"I am from the States and thought this is the dumbest name for a Mexican restaurant....Wilbur? What the heck is that? How about Canexico!!

The Food was absolutely fantastic, the steak fajitas were delicious and my wife loved the Carne Asada tacos. I would eat here every week if I lived close..."
1,"I've had my share of Yummy Yummy Dumplings in my day, especially when I used to live in California, I was a pretty wild child, and that's not even including dumplings in a food sense. If you think dumplings are something that gets served with Roast Beef and Gravy, then leave the Midwest for a week or so, and fly up to Toronto and get schooled.

What to get: Pan Fried Dumplings
What else: While these are amazing, you *must* try the ones at Dumpling House too

So I make notes after I eat somewhere, which I later use in a review where I add all the flowery language and bad jokes and flowery language and repetition and flowery language. And my notes for YYD say:

Incredible dumplings, wonderful service from girl, really delicious pan fried pork dumplings with hot oil, yum, cheap, friendly, bathroom, not busy.

I'm not sure what \""bathroom\"" means. That they have a bathroom? That the bathroom is nice? That it is awful? That it is notable in some way? Welcome to the wonderful world of making notes that you don't actually understand months later.

What I do know is that the girl really was one of the best servers I've had in Canada. So friendly and helpful and lovely. I wanted to ask for her number, but the guy in the booth behind me was an ex and I didn't want any jealousy issues, so. I'm a dumpling lover, not a fighter.

The hot oil is a big deal. Add it to the dumplings for a little kick. Cheap is right. It's almost sad how cheap the dumplings are in Chinatown. But that just means you can order more right? How many dumplings can you fit in your mouth? Back in 'Frisco I could do 10 at a time. But that was before I discovered that dumplings were also a food item.

What else I do know is that when I'm in Toronto and I want dumplings, there are 2 places I go. Dumpling House for literally the best on the planet, unlike any other you'll ever have. And then here to the much quieter, much more friendly, unassuming YYD, for traditional style, wet, juicy, perfect Pork And Chive Dumplings. Of the two, I'd pick the other every time. But you kind of have to go to both. Not least because this place is often as quiet as .....

.....

....

As that. Whereas the other is often, wait for a table and then get thrown out the door as you suck the juice out of your last dumpling.

Oh, sucking juice out of dumplings. Those were the days.

But anyway back to food.

Come to Toronto. Visit Chinatown. Try the dumplings here, and at Dumpling House nearby on Spadina. Fried Pork And Chive, both times. Or the non-fried here are great too. Then try Pork Bone Soup from Keor Ak San. And don't forget to go all the way up to Kevin's Taiyaki for a custard fish shaped dessert. After those 4 stops, you'll have tried the very best that Asian Toronto has to offer. You can wash it all down with an exquisite Banh Mi from Banh Mi Boys.

Speaking of boys. Oh how I miss those California dumplings. Yummy Yummy in my tummy was actually my nickname in San Francisco in '77. Ah well. Times change."
2,This restaurant is a waste of time and money. Don't spend your money there. They are so unprofessional and rude!!! the food was old and taste bad. I wouldn't go back there.
3,"Rating: 3 1/2* (2 1/2* to 3* for the food and I will say that is a solid 4* for the cocktails)

We were going to a concert at the Air Canada Centre and decided to have dinner beforehand. We picked the Miller as it is conveniently located just minutes from the ACC along with a public parking right in front of it. We made a reservation as we figured that it will probably be busy because of the concert and the dinner rush. 

We were seated promptly when we arrived and it was a good idea that we made the reservation as the place was very busy. Place is big and spacious as we were seated in a booth near the entrance.

Our waiter was great as he was attentive and told us about the specials and some of the dishes in the menu. We went with Crab Cakes to start and ordered the Chicken Schnitzel, the Kebabs and the Halibut as main. We also ordered the Red Mule Cocktail. The food started right as the cocktails and the crab cakes were excellent. However, the mains were just average at best. With the prices that they are charging for them, it was quite disappointing how average they were. 

It seems their close proximity to the ACC, keeps people coming to this place.

Next time, I will come for the drinks and not bother with the food.

#44 of 2018"
3,"This place is happening on Thusday night.  Quite busy so service is kinda lacking but atmosphere is good. We could only eat at the sides so we didnt get a table. 


Pros
-high quality tacos and corn
-must try ice cream, c&c is worth it 


cons
-$$ for what you get"
2,"Rosewood was a great Dim Sum spot downtown when it first opened up a couple of months ago, but the quality and service of the restaurant has quickly declined. 

After my most recent visit I will not be returning. The food was brought to us just lukewarm, tea was tasteless and the waitress did not respond to our request for more tea leaves when refilling the pot. Also, the waitress started clearing the table without asking if we were done with our meal. Note that it was not busy at all on a weekday morning. While clearing the table she bumped into my teacup which i was taking a sip from and did not apologize even though it led to spilling tea on my clothes. Obviously this led to a smaller tip, and guess what? The waitresses have the guts to ask for more tip.

As a foodie, I frequent the area often and my advice is to STAY AWAY!"
2,"A group of my girlfriends and I grabbed drinks here on a Sunday night. We chose this bar because it was very close to our hotel and one of the only bars opened at night. 

Surprisingly, when we walked in, there were still a few patrons dining and a large group just starting to order seated close to us. Although it was late, we still received great service and our drinks were delicious! We were grateful to find a place so welcoming in the eleventh hour!"
2,Food was delicious! I can't believe the half rack was only a half rack. It was huge and tasty... I will be back.
2,"Not bad but not great either. 

Cutely decorated with odd bits and ends splayed around the space like license plates, famous celeb photos etc. Tables are crowded into another so you would have to not mind sitting next to your neighbours directly though there a few tables that are seperated off from the long rows of tables. I went to 7 numbers a few years ago at the original location on Eglinton and remember having a highlight lasagna with a very great tomato sauce. Sadly this is no more or did not at least translate over to the Danforth location, the version I tasted recently was only a few notches above what chef boyardee's pasta. 

Come here if you want passable italian cooking at good prices in a boisterous, campy atmosphere."
2,"Very limited choices, and very small menu.  Only 5 tables, tiny little space.  The green onion pancake was very oily and very salty.  The firey wontons are in a very hot spicy peanut butter based sauce.  They could do with more flavor and less heat  Deep fried eggplant - neither of us could eat it.  Huge clumps of dough surrounding mushy eggplamt.  The beef pancake - was just okay, lots of oily dough and large pieces of coriander, not much meat.  The shrimp and pork soup dumplings were pleasant but frankly I don't see why people rave over with them.  They were okay.  Getting back to the 401 was a nightmare of driving through Toronto city streets as the Don V was closed.  If you aren't in the immediate neighbourhood, believe me, this is not worth the drive!  Another Yelp disappointment for us.  Parking is almost non existent.  I wish we had tried the beef noodle soup but doubt it could compare to the Sogo anyway."
2,"I was a part of the 20 person table that Rebecca S wrote about in her review, and everything she wrote was accurate. It's inexcusable to know ahead of time that a large group is coming and be unprepared for it - our server actually told us \""I wish your group had come yesterday, we were less busy yesterday and could have given you better service!\"" And this was on a night when the restaurant was 40% full. I can't imagine what the service would be like if the restaurant were 100% full."
1,"I'll bet you didn't know that Greg C and I were twins. We both (unknowingly) dined at the same two restaurants within a 24 hour period. 

And at the second of these, the newly re-opened Pulp Kitchen, we ordered the same sandwich AND juice! So bizarre. The \""PK Sandwich\"" consists of crispy breaded tofu, oven roasted tomatoes, sliced avocado and cilantro dijon mayo on toasted flax served with baked homefries and mixed greens ($9.50). With that I had a V6 juice (freshly juiced tomato, spinach, carrot, celery, beet and green pepper). 

What I like about the fresh juices here is that they come in three sizes, the smallest of which is actually quite affordable if all you want is a sampling of flavour. I believe it's $3 for 250mL. 

My sandwich was excellent - so good, in fact, that I ordered it again a few days later when I dined with Greg C, along with the soup of the day, tomato rice. I love rice soups and this one was no exception. I had a hard time deciding between it and the butternut squash and black bean chili but I know I'll soon be back to try that one as well. 

The decor is nice and simple and they have a partially open kitchen where you can see your food being made. I also like the fact that they sell merchandise, and healthy cookbooks would be a nice addition to their stock.

As mentioned in my review of the original Pulp Kitchen (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pulp-kitchen-toronto#hrid:txkfA5A65041jULL-46djw - now the home of Lady Marmalade), I must take issue with their early hours - for a person like me who works from home nearby, only being open till 6pm is fine, but I would love to bring a friend here for dinner sometime. Unfortunately it's not possible. Perhaps as they find their place in Leslieville they'll expand their hours - after all, they've only been open since the beginning of November."
3,"This place gets really busy sometimes so I do applaud the efficiency of the employees. They are also very kind and they make good suggestions about what you should try and how much sugar you should put in your drink for example. 

The reason why I would not rate this place higher is because of the amount of ice they put in their drinks. Don't get me wrong, I love some ice in my drink but I do not want a whole iceberg in there. I even asked for very little ice and instead, half of my cup was filled with ice. My drink tasted good for the first 10 sips. Then it just tasted like water. 

If I am paying $4-$5 for some bubble tea, I would want it to taste like that and not some water that has \""hints\"" of tea flavour."
1,"This is a 5 stars for quality/price. Some of the deep fried stuff was not maximally crispy, and the pizza (Porchetta and pistachio with honey) was a bit on the nose. That said: everything was delicious and so so so so so reasonably priced. Service was delightful. I'll be back and I hope they can find their feet in terms of audience/consistency of the food. This is such a good idea---for those of us who love neapolitan food."
2,"We were enjoying a mini bar crawl on a sunny Friday night when we decided to make Bar Bataviato our final stop. We made our way upstairs and immediately found a cozy table by the bar.

We spent some time perusing their promising drink menu and eventually settled on the Weekly Punch, which we got in the Punch Your Friends size. (It's a small bottle, basically.) It's a tasty drink; fruity and refreshing, it was pretty much exactly what we wanted. I will say, though, that the alcohol content seemed very low, like maybe a couple of ounces in the entire bottle. So that was a little disappointing.

I was also feeling a little peckish, so I decided to try their Rendang Taco, which I figured would consist of the amazing Beef Rendang they serve downstairs at Little Sister. I was not wrong, and this thing was amazing. I could've eaten, like, five of these."
2,"Such a cute little Café. I've always wanted to come here as I am borderline obsessed with cute teddy bears! So I've really come to the right place.

I love their selection of espresso, frappés, got chocolate, lattes, smoothies and more. I was slightly disappointed with their dessert selection. Although they had a few, I was hopping for a more home made dessert and now the so called mass produced \""la rocca\"" mini dessert which were tasty but I can get anywhere. With the authenticity and unique concept of a Café, I was hoping for a cool dessert to go along with their cool drink menu. 

I love how they play paddington bear in the sitting area, they decorate the cafe to each holiday. I went and it was Halloween themed! Super cute! 

Also you can buy your own bear and dress it up... \""build a bear\"" much. 

This place caters more for younger kids but hey! Aren't we all at heart!?"
2,"The food was great.  I had the egg benny and Arshawn had their home made scone and an egg.  I confirm, the Cortado is exceptional here.  The service was slow, but the staff were super apologetic and it seemed to me this wasn't the usual MO.  Will definitely come back."
2,"Excellent handmade authentic pizzas, better than Queen Margarita & Libretto! The dough is what makes the difference - it's perfectly balanced between crispy and chewy. The porchetta sandwich was OK. It was good prochetta, but one-dimensional. We prefer the ones at Porchetta & Co. because of the extra fixings we can get on it. The atmosphere is laid-back - a homey Italian cafe. It is very kid-friendly, and most tables around us had come with their kids."
2,"This is probably my favorite fast food store in North York. Their stake sandwich is one of the best!
Fries with yogurt sauce is awesome!"
2,"The essence: A warm inviting atmosphere and interesting Portuguese cuisine options.

The food: While the food was pleasant, it wasn't special.  

The experience: The service was slightly glitchy all evening.  The acoustics and seating somehow made it hard to hear my wife, but everything said at the neighboring table was clear as a bell. 

The summary verdict: I'd have no problem eating here with you if you wanted to give it a try, but I'd probably be a bit more excited to explore other options before coming back."
2,I'm a bit surprised by the reviews. I've eaten here twice and had great meals both times. Staff were kind and attentive. Food was quick and tasty. Really liked the saki as well.
2,"I ordered some salad and pizza some time. I love the way they cook, and it fresh as always. This place will come on my mind if I want to have pizza. Pizza was tasty and fresh as well as salads By the way, they probably take a bit long time but for me im okay with that :)"
2,"If I could give it less than 1 star I will give it -10.  Terrible experience, had food poisoning after eating there on my birthday.  Spent the rest of my birthday hugging the toilet afterwards.  Don't go there!!!"
2,Came here on a Wednesday afternoon and had an amazing time! The staff were very friendly and the service in general was great. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and my friend ordered the eel bibimbap and neither of us were disappointed. The waitress for our table even asked us if we wanted any refills for our banchan! I never write Yelp reviews but the staff was so great so I had to! Hopefully you guys enjoy your experience there as well :)
2,"A previous experience had been quite delightful & I attended this time with a companion, to whom I had shared this with. Sadly, things were not at all the same with respect to food quality only. 
The service and attention were impeccable. The Wine list was extensive but the tomato sauce on my Veal Parmigiana tasted as if it had come from a jar at the supermarket. The portion was skimpy, in view of the price. My friend had chicken Marsala and the verdict was bland. The appetizer mussels were drowned in the same sauce as the veal parmigiana. The prominent flavour of garlic in most Italian cooking was noticeably absent. 
I won't be going back."
2,"We got the Mushroom Madness and the Classic with bacon. Food was ok, staff were nice...I guess I just expected more via the ratings. Good but not great..."
1,"While my Yelp kin were busy stuffing their maws on the breast of Motha India at a UYE, I was on the other end of Queen Street taking flight, wine flights that is at the PicNic Wine Bar.  I was meeting up with a past employee who I was trying to lure back to my agency and when I asked her where she'd like to meet up she suggested PicNic since it is her her hood.  Immediately I routed the Yelp reviews and noted that all of them were four stars so this was a good sign.  

It was a great evening.  We just kicked back and took in the atmosphere.  I love the vibe in this room and considering that we were sitting next to the front door that is really giving a big thumbs up to this spot.  Usually sitting next to the front door on a frosty winter's night is a chilling experience but for whatever reason the glass across the front of this bar is air tight and not even remotely draughty.  If you do get a chill there is a basket of rolled up pashmina's/wraps sitting by the front door.  Such thoughtfulness on the part of this establishment.

There is a good selection of wines by the ounce (3 or 6), half bottles & full bottles.  Or you can go with a wine flight and get 3 glasses of wine with 2 ounces each in them.  So we started with a Chardonnay flight and I must say the sommelier, Matt, is a great guy.  He puts the glasses down on the table, pours right at the table and tells you what each wine is.  No way were these a two ounce pour, easily a generous 3 ouncer.   Tasting wine in this manner is a great way to learn about how different chardonnays from Chile, California, Canada and Australia can be.  The legs, the nose, the body....no this is not me describing another Dexter episode.  

We ordered a cheese/meat/condiment plate to start.  There is a blackboard on the backwall giving you the choices so you build your own charcuterie plate.  Our only requests were that one cheese be creamy and rich and the other be stinky.  The plate came with a heaping basket of very fresh, crispy baguette.  Along side we had a fruit condiment, spicy olives and some slatherings of olive oil on the plate.  As far as charcuterie boards I've had way better and this was the only reason I yanked a star off this rating.  Still though, it was good but when you've had great (Black Hoof/Splendido/Local) it's a tough act to follow.  

We ordered the Tuna Tartare which was sooooo delicious with black sesame seeds in it.  It was sided with these really cool lotus chips and wakame salad.  We also ordered the chicken satays that showed up sitting atop a bed of couscous with lentils and bulgur.  It was delicious and had a real madras of flavours.  Both plates were beautifully splayed with their food and garnishes.  

Our second flight was with reds and we tried a great Ripasso from Italy (our fave), a Carmeniere from Chile and a Cab Sav from the Cali coast.  In both tastings we found one wine we liked more than the other and opted to have a second tasting.  It was a booze' em up night in Riverdale and we loved every minute of it.  

Downside to PicNic, no desserts.  (insert pout here)  I'm going to have to work on them!  It would have been nice to finish off with something chocolatey and rich.  Alas, it was not to be.  The other comment I have to make about PicNic is that the room is fairly consumed by a large communal table, which is ok but I don't care for backless chairs.  If you are going to sit for a while slurping up the grape I like to have a chair I can lean back against.  

In total there were 16 small pours with all the food and the bill came to $120 which I felt was very fair.  It was a great evening, music was fab, service was attentive and respectful and the room is super comfy for wine libations.  Oh by the way, my ploy worked.  My former staff is coming on back!  Thank you PicNic for helping me seal the deal!"
3,"Crazy expensive for mediocre results at best. $100 for pizza, wings, and a salad. Salad came with no dressing whatsoever and they did nothing to help compensate or solve the problem, claimed that there certainly is dressing on the salad although there's clearly not. Will not be dining again."
1,"Yummy food, great service, and bang for your buck. I got the chicken burger and seafood pancake. Both were delicious and large. I will definitely be going back to try their other items."
3,"unique hipster joint....

fun friendly staff..  food tasted good but portions are quite small.

pricey but you should expect it when eating at a place like this... unique menu that changes."
2,"Food was great and service fast and friendly. Ambience and sides could use a little boost. 

Will definitely be back!"
2,"The first thing that I noticed when I walked in was how clean this place is. The burritos are delicious, good food quickly? Friendly service and well organized!
There is definitely no lack of topping selections for whatever burrito you decide to have. I tried a half chicken half steak burrito (not on the menu) but I think they'll make you anything you'd like. My next try will be a Haddock burrito... I wonder if that's going to be similar to a fish taco? Stay tuned...
The owner (I think) was sweeping up outside ensuring the exterior was clean and free of cigarette butts. A rare thing to see these days.
I was left with the impression of 'clean and friendly service'. Will definitely be back and would definitely recommend."
1,Got the shrimp pad thai today.  Huge portion for $9.26 after tax.  Very filling and tasty.  Delicious blend of flavours and amazing staff on hand.
2,"cool concept but i wouldnt go back.
i got the \""five star bowl\"" which was veg. halfway through it i was already done with it. i'd recommend the bowls at kupfert and kim instead. my bowl hd a weird aftertaste."
2,Perogies was good! It was a bit oily but the onions and garnishes that came with it was yummy. Servers were nice and the ambience was also great to catch up with friends.
2,"I'm a fan. They serve some thin crust pizza and it's not overly greasy. Think the opposite of Pizza Hut. I also like how you can customize your pizza with many unique ingredients and they don't charge premiums for certain toppings like every other pizza place. Gorgonzola, italian meatballs, spinach, etc. Get whatever you want!  You can also pick from classic sauce, cream sauce or spicy sauce. We tried the classic but I'd gladly return to try the spicy one next time. The pizza was pretty good and top that off with the great customization options and you've got yourself a great pizzeria."
2,"I've always wanted to try this place. I've passed by it many times and I finally got a chance! 

The decor was great and the booth seat we were at was by the patio so a gentle breeze wafted in often to cool us off. The server, who is extremely courteous and welcoming, explained the giant meatball and was very patient with my indecisiveness. I must have taken 10 minutes to decide. Honestly, I wanted to try everything, and I still do. 

I got the fettuccini capri, which is a seafood pasta. My bf got the spaghetti and stuffed meatball. My friend recommended me the pasta hence my decision. 

Wow :D stuff tasted super fresh and their pasta is great! Texture is good, and the chewiness was interesting. Despite being fettuccini and spaghetti, it was able to absorb the taste. Also, it didn't break even though I twirled it hard. 

We also had calamari but it came out soggy. We were like ehh but the server came and asked us how it was. I said \""it's.. Alright\"". He was immediately concerned and asked what was wrong with  it. I told him and he offered to bring a new calamari free of charge, and apologized profusely for the error. We waited a while and he checked back with us, and we said we don't have it yet. 

He went into the kitchen and got us a brand new dish of calamari that looked and smelled great. It was even tucked into a newspaper cone, which had not been done for our first calamari. He apologized again and said the head chef checked before sending it out. 

Not sure if it's true, but it tasted totally different. 

The customer service was phenomenal here. Thank you, man loop server with a NZ accent! You're splendid."
2,"Equipt with good food, good coffee ,and great atmosphere, this is the kind of place to go for a social meet up or to just enjoy a nice brunch. Given the area this Cafe is very unique and offers a very sleek and comfortable place to fuel up on caffeine."
2,"So happy to have another restaurant in the area! I work nearby but there's not a great selection of places to grab lunch when I'm on my break.  I've worked in this neigbhourhood for nearly 5 years, and I don't drive.. I can't even tell you how sick to death I am of eating Tim Hortons for lunch!

I noticed the big orange sign when having a meeting in our office so I took a walk by to check it out. Very nice, contemporary styled dining room. Very large with plenty of seating, so it will be easy to get a table at lunch time or dinner time- unlike the neighbouring Vi Pei which is pretty much always packed. 

Thai Indeed has a great lunch special menu.  Pretty much any thai dish that you're craving is featured at some point during the week on the lunch special menu.  Today I picked up the Green Curry Chicken and Rice.  Lunch specials come with a choice of soup or salad and spring rolls.  Around $10 for the meal. 

The serving is generous, fresh and simply delicious.  I had the hot & and sour soup, and tbh, I only ordered it because I'm feeling under the weather today.  I'm not usually a fan of hot & sour soup.. but this one was so good! I finished the whole tub (and my sore throat is cured! I think I found a better cure to the common cold than chicken soup!)

The green curry is exactly as spicy as I like it.. Very hot, but not enough to burn my face off. Super flavourful-- with that bit of sweetness that soaks into the chicken.  So yummy. 

They packed up my sticky rice in a take out container--the rice was shaped like a star, and topped with a garnish. Super cute. 

The service was fast-- the owners/managers were very friendly and excited to share their new restaurant with their new customers. 

10/10.  I'm so glad this place is open after I'm done work, because I know where I'll be grabbing my take-out dinners from now on!"
2,"Love the look and Interesting ambiance of this place.  The entrance is down an alley covered in graffiti and very rustic inside.  Doorway looks like a speakeasy from days gone by!  There is a good size patio on the ground floor and great room upstairs with a bar area.  Meeting upstairs is great for groups as our group of 15 did.  We were able to converse and hear each other even with the music playing in the background.  
A couple of folks in my group ordered sangria's and they looked great in the tall glass and tasted great as well.  White or red sangria was available.  Good variety of beer and great prices on the pitchers to share.
Great prices and great choices in the menu with a wide variety of appetizers as well as mains.
Interesting variety of soups with Lentil, Beef Satay and tried the Seafood Udon which was delicious with nice juicy noodles.
I ordered the Vermicelli noodles special with lemongrass pork which comes with fresh lettuce, cabbage, peppers and carrots.  Also comes with a crispy spring roll on top,  Very unique flavors and thoroughly enjoyed.

Will certainly go back as there are a number of interesting items on the menu to try and just love the feel of the place."
2,"Quant and cozy authentic Italian restaurant in the heart of Toronto. You almost feel like you're in New Yorks little Italy. Very romantic ambience but also cozy family vibe. Very tasty pasta dishes, so fresh and authentic. Also the caprese salad and grilled calamari were excellent starter choices. For the mains I highly recommend the Bolognese and seafood spagetti as they were incredible!"
2,"I have frequented this location many times, the ambiance is great, the staff is professional and the food is always amazing! The Ahi Tuna is always fresh and a great starter! The top sirloin is loaded with flavour. Those mushrooms, wow, better than magic mushrooms! A trip is never complete without a billy miner pie, packed with more deliciousness than 31 flavours! 

Side note: the ribs are good, but if you're going to the Keg don't not order a steak, you'll just look on in envy when everyone is eating that sweet juicy meat."
3,"Delicious, healthy food! The continuing saturation of the \""experience burger\"" in Toronto, with so many establishments offering similarly decadent, belt-busting menus, has left the city's burger fans adrift in a homogeneous sea of sanctimoniously prepared ground beef. Which I think is part of the reason that Bareburger gets low marks from some reviewers who are hoping for larger portion size for their buck. That's not what Bareburger is about, though. It's not the latest incarnation of Burger's Priest/Hero Burger/Rude Boy, and I think if you go in with those expectations, you'll be disappointed.

Bareburger's emphasis is on top-quality, organic, non-GMO, etc., etc. ingredients. This is naturally going to up the price point and, in connection with that, affect portions. They offer various sandwiches, salads, and all types of vegan, gluten-free alternatives for burgers, including a few different bun options (collard green wrap, for example), vegan cheese, etc. Of course, they also have plenty of meat and the usual between-the-bun suspects (bacon, fried eggs, duck fat, etc.), but it's all about as organic/ethically produced as it gets. 

Bareburger has complete nutritional information on their website, including a user interface to calculate custom orders, so if you care to count your macros, you can.

The ambiance is low-key with a side of reclaimed wood. You don't feel like you're in a cafeteria or anything and the decor is nice, but it definitely gives off the vibe that your meal might not last longer than an hour.

Entrees:
Fiance, a friend and I ordered a sandwich, a burger, and collard-green wrap respectively. We also tried different sides: fries, sweet potato fries, and the wasabi coleslaw. 

As a card-carrying gluten-free cadet, I was happy as a clam with the Farmstead sweet potato and rice patty with cauliflower hummus and wrapped up in the greens. I was delighted with the taste and how filling it was. Would definitely get it again.

The SP fries were hands down some of the best I've had in the city, super crispy and hitting all the right sweet-and-salty notes. Fiance's fries were similarly solid, and our friend's coleslaw was fresh and tasty--although we all commented that the wasabi flavor was there, but lacked the normal heat that accompanies everyone's favorite fiery green condiment. 

Dranks:
They have a good selection of beers, house-made sodas and milkshakes. We stuck to beers.

Service: 
A bit slow, particularly given that it wasn't busy, but friendly and generally attentive.

It's not cheap, with the al a carte burgers coming in at over $10 a piece, but if you're looking for something health-conscious, this is a fantastic place to indulge. I'm definitely going to be back!"
2,"I went to the host this evening with my family and had the worst experience. Our server brought our drinks and spilt a bottle of coke all over me! She apologized but did not seem genuine. She then went on to take our order. When she brought the food the portion size was much smaller than its been in the past! The food was also quite salty. Halfway through we get another server and the other girl disappears. We get our bill and there is no discount given the initial server ruined my sweater and jeans!! She didn't even ask if she could cover my dry cleaning!! I then had to go talk to our new server told him the story and he made it like he didn't. Then the old server comes back and tries to give a 9.00 discount?? I told her my dry cleaning would probably be over 30 bucks. My top was pretty expensive! She then comes back saying they could only give a certain discount! Anyway point is this place had no intention of paying the consequences for what they did, server was not very nice about the whole situation so I probably will not go back again!!"
2,"Bar Raval has a special place in my heart. It's a cozy yet very action packed neighbourhood bar that serves fantastic tapas dishes you can enjoy while sipping a glass of wine from their fantastic collection or a cocktail masterfully crafted by the bartender. This is a place that fully represents joy and laughter. The staff is extremely nice and I assure you that you will be treated like part of the family. The interior design was purposefully created to establish an environment that promotes socializing with other patrons, so let your guard down and mingle a little. 

Their food offerings change seasonally, but definitely try the raw seafood bar that offers from juicy oysters to crab. The octopus is one of my all time favourites. It's garlicky with a hint of lemon, the texture is soft but yet has a great bite that adds a level of texture that elevates this dish. Pro tip: mop up the delicious oil that's infused with garlic, octopus and herbs with some bread. 

If in season I would also recommend the sweetbreads. If you are not familiar with what a sweetbread is the simplest way to think of it is the scallop of the land. The flavour is complex and has a great mouthfeel that you should wash down with some pinot noir."
2,"I had the Commander Burger. It was just ok for me, not jumping up and down.  The patty was good. It was juicy - but way too juicy (watery) to a point that it wet the bun so much and I had to eat it so fast.  I like the fries and that creamy dip that came with fries though.  I give food 2.5 but because the owner was so nice and friendly, I bumped it up to 3.  I may go back and will for try the specialty burgers."
2,"Tucked away in the basement of an old building, this low key burrito place will fill you right up. Definitely one of the better burrito places around the area. Tasty meat, not too salty and huge portions."
2,We came here for Winterlicious 2016 because the menu offered a lot of simple seafood dishes. The only (slight) miss was the bisque - everything else was very well prepared and delicious. I would certainly come back to try their full menu.
1,"The Cucumber Mule and the Frozen Margaritas are possibly my favourite drinks EVER. Very sweet but that's how I like it so no complaints here. The pizza is also great - the perfect crispy-but-chewy texture! 

Great spot for post-work drinks/dinner and surprisingly affordable for FiDi area given their great happy hour/late night specials ($6 margaritas / $5 beers / half off pizzas!!!)"
2,"We order pickup from this place periodically. It's average at best but there really aren't any great Chinese food places nearby. I like the egg rolls and soup. Tonight we ordered soup, egg rolls, black bean chicken, shanghai noodles, and crispy ginger beef. Noodles were bland, chicken was slimy, and there was a STAPLE IN MY BEEF (see picture). It was not sitting on top but embedded inside the beef. How does that even happen?? I could have been feeding this to my child - or I could have swallowed it and have it perforated my organs!
The owner apologized and offered us a free crispy beef next time. Not that I plan on ordering from there again but that's the kind of offer you make if someone finds hair in their food...not when they find something that could have seriously injured them! 
Will never order from there again. I can see from the reviews on here that they seem to have an issue with metal items and bugs being found in their food."
2,Always delicious. I love their raging bull items. They have the perfect level of spice.  Their meat mixture is perfect and the beef is always cooked to perfection.  I also recommend the raging bull fries.  This has to be my favourite burger joint in the gta. I wish there was one closer to my home.  FYI the St.  Claim location is better than the Vaughan location.
2,"Decent McDonalds. The only highlight is that it's located in Union Station. Come here if you're hungry for a burger and fries. Nothing special so just fork over your change, wait 5 mins, chow down and climb on your bus or train! There's normally a line but service is very fast. It's located near the Jugo Juice."
2,"This is honestly one of the best patios in the area and has recently been updated with new tables, benches and chairs to replace the plastic lawn furniture that was here before. I have a feeling this is due to the increased competition in the area with the Firkin having recently renovated and The Garage re-opening before the Summer.

The service is usually pretty fast here, and if you stick to bottled beer you can't go far wrong. For whatever reason, I feel awful the next day after a pint or two of draught beer at this place.

Regarding the food, it's standard pub fare and nothing to write home about. I was here last night with a friend who had the Cobb Salad and it looked pretty good, so maybe things are looking up on the food side too.

Summary:  Come for the patio, not the food or draught beers."
2,"We had been recommended to try this restaurant by Chef Jan Bangerter of Langdon Hall, so we expected it would be excellent, and it was. It is an understated space, but the food is tremendous - from the freshly baked sour-dough with fresh cheese spread (including a sprinkle of shallots) to the apricot tart, every dish was excellent. My wife's shrimp escabiche probably slightly out-shone my steak tartare, but they were each a great start. My salmon was probably the best prepared salmon I've every had and her roasted chicken in a miso bath was delicious.

The wine list is sort, but very well curated, as is their list of beers. The petit manseng was a perfect pairing with the apricot tart.

This restaurant deserves all its kudos!"
2,"Notes from my 3rd visit to pf changs...

Seated as soon as we walk in at 9:50... so far so good... there were multiple empty tables around yet our greeter decided to sit us in the corner at a table that was not clean.  Drink platter sitting on the bench, someone elses dinner experience still on the table.   After the greeter failed to realize that we were less then impressed with the table, I had to ask for the table to be re cleaned.  Looked at the menu, decided which food would be devoured, looked at the drink menu and decided what drink would fit our food and then proceeded to wait.  And wait... and continue to wait as others were served, and we were left on our own.  Finally a server came around and cracked an joke about \""saving the day\"" to take our order after 20 minuets.  I think she could tell we were unimpressed.  The food came, and in typical PF Chang's style it was delicious.  By the time I looked up, our half of the restaurant was empty and some of the staff was busy counting tips and cleaning around us.  It was now 11 pm.  Something seemed wrong about this in general.  Not sure if it was the counting of tips while i was enjoying some Mongolian Beef or the another server walking by saying \""I quit\"" (albeit sarcastically) That was more disturbing.  It goes to show that the lack of attention that the staff now currently employed here has.  Finally, being given the bill without asking for it and asked to pay as we were 20 minutes from closing was the final straw.   Overall the food is still as good as ever but the service seems to have fallen off quite a bit."
2,"Ewwwwww. Worst wings ever!!!!    

I am normally a fan of the St. Louis Bar and Grill franchise but this location sucks.  

Ordered wings last week for take-out and they were the DRIEST wings I think I've ever had in my life.  Thank God for that dill sauce or else the whole meal would have been inedible.  We asked for medium and the level of spice was completely undetectable... didn't even taste like they put any sauce on them at all.  Also, the celery sticks we got were WHITE, not green like celery should be. They were also served in a puddle of water.

One of the worst meals I've had in a long time....  

I'll be sticking to the Atrium or Yonge & Eg locations for my wing fix from now on, thank you very much."
2,"This place is really bad never ever go here the 
I went here on a Saturday for lunch and the first thing I noticed it that all ingredients are old and the seaweed that wrapped the sushi was aired out and lacked the crunchiness, my seafood fried rice was served in the smallest portion I've ever seen, also it had some sorta fish but it had a really bad after taste. All the crabmeat in my maki felt like rubber.
The menu in overall was smaller than most places and lacked choice including the drink menu they only had 2 kinds for beer. My bbq ells sushi has no rice at the bottom. The atmosphere is mediocre and not pleasing. My seating was uncomfortable they didn't want me sit where I want just for ease of cleaning up."
2,"I was really looking forward to my dinner at the Chase given its status and reputation in the city. Unfortunately, our experience dining at this Bay Street institution did not live up to expectations. I made a reservation at 8.45pm on a Thursday night, which of course meant that the odds of being seated at the reserved time were slim. I was less than surprised when our hostess let us know that our table was still \""finishing dessert\"".

 I am not sure what kind of dessert the guests at our table were having but it must have been a multi-course dessert because 45 minutes later, we were still sitting in the lounge with our drinks. It took exactly an hour to finally be seated and suffice to say that not a single staff member came off as genuinely apologetic. It seems to me that this restaurant has already taken on a pretentious attitude that people should consider themselves \""lucky\"" to dine there. The single and only time the manager came to our table was to drop off an amuse bouche, which I assumed was a gesture for the delay in seating, but an apology was never once verbally uttered. In fact, aside from never once returning back to the table, on my way to the bathroom I witnessed him leaving to go home with a restaurant packed full on a Thursday night. 

Luckily, our server was excellent and I really had no complaints as she was extremely friendly and professional throughout the night. The same cannot be said about the sommelier who must have been having a bad day because I don't think I saw her smile once. To make matters worse, our mains took over half an hour to arrive after our appetizers took a mere 8 minutes. It pains me to rate this restaurant so low because the food really is outstanding. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the way they treat people here. The least they could have done was comp the two drinks we had at the lounge, but with an absent/nonchalant manager that night, that did not happen. As such, I simply cannot recommend this restaurant."
2,"Three and a half stars. 
Four stars for the meat patty by itself. 

On a good day I have trouble just trying to figure out what pair of socks to put on let alone pick up a menu that has 35 burger options staring me in the face. Someone over at the Yellow Griffin has way too much time on their hands and must have consumed a ton of pints the day they sat down and came up with all these goofy burger names. Why do people think a pun is fun on a bun? The kvetch included burger names such as the Burning School House, Skippy Dipper, Don Juan and St. Peter's Burger. 

My Decemburger quest continued, this time in the trendy Bloor West Village at Runnymede and Bloor. The YG is really more just a local watering hole with just as many beer options as burgers. More challenges for me. In the end I opted for the Creme Caramel which is the burger with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and a tangy BBQ sauce and sided it with fries. All the burgers range price with the cheapest being $9.95 and it escalates from there. For a bison burger you add $2.75 to the bottom line. The price tag includes a side (fries, sweet potato fries, greens, potato salad, onion rings) which you choose. I opted for the fries with a side order of gravy. 

You have no burger patty size options at the YG. Everything is 8 ounces and let me tell you 8 ounces is a pretty hefty burger. I'd even go as far to say that this burger was 8 ounces cooked which means it probably started out at almost 10 ounces raw.  It was a two hander all the way.  I had read Susan C.'s review on the Burger Bar where she complained about the bun overpowering the meat well this is totally not the case at the YG. That patty is huge and what was even nicer was the middle of it was super juicy and pink. Now this might scare the crap outta those paralyzed in fear of being poisoned by improperly cooked meat but I didn't flinch. Mamma was loving her some meat on Bloor Street. 

On the patty alone I would have given this spot five stars. What knocked a a star off was that the \""tangy\"" BBQ sauce which really tasted like out of a jar Kraft sauce.  It was cloying and distracting to taste of the meat. Good BBQ sauce should enhance not distract you from the meat. Fries were decent. Hot, crispy and plentiful. I have had better but then again I've had a lot worse. The gravy was delicious and actually tasted as though it had been made from beef drippings. A rarity for gravy in restaurants these days. 

Service was spotty. It wasn't all that busy when we arrived. We got drinks right away but it took a few minutes to get our waitresses attention to order food. After she brought me my plate it took me another wait to get condiments. The condiment rack arrives and I say to her \""do you have any relish\"" to which she replies \""relish? I don't think so.\"" What the eff? A burger place with no relish but a menu that has hundred of other toppings for your burgers? I don't get this. Eventually she comes back to me with a little plastic cup. in it a splotch of relish. 

After a couple of weeks of gobbling up ground beef on a bun I'm reaching the point where I'd like to pick an oleo of the burger elements of the different restos I've been in and out. The patty from the Yellow Griffin, the bun from the Burger Bar, the caramelized onions from Craft Burger, the sweet potato fries from the Original Motorcycle Burger and so it goes. 

My quest continues. I'll tell ya, after a few weeks of this, the thought of eating turkey at Christmas is beginning to look pretty damn good. (urp)"

3,Expensive and not worth to spend money on this not so delicious food. very little foods in the bowl. The food cost $3in china cost $20 here.
1,"Friendly, knowledgeable and quick service make this place welcoming, and the food lives up to the gorgeous rustic interior. We ordered the ribs and brisket with onion rings and slaw on the side. Brisket beautifully tender, ribs agreeably spicy if a touch on the dry side. Slaw was amazing - not overly saucy, crisp and crunchy. Good selection of drinks and great value. And our lovely server brought us tequila as an end to the meal! Excellent place, really recommended."
2,"I'm a big fan of boils! With that said, this place hit the spot. My group of 7 lucked out and got seated immediately upon walking in. I literally tried EVERYTHING on that menu.  Every seafood choice they offered down to their rice plates, down to the steamed okra. The only ones that stood out to me were the mussels and shrimp.  Even then, everything seemed too buttery and after a few minutes,  the sauce started clumping/coagulating.  The crab legs, clams, and mussels were tasty,  don't get me wrong.  Ultimately,  I left 100$ broker and it wasn't a memorable boil for me.  I would come again given the opportunity though."
1,"Food is at best so-so at this restaurant, but what you are paying for is the view of Toronto at the comfort of your own setting while eating a 3-course meal that won't leave you hungry afterwards.  Lunch prix fixe is CAD55 while the entrance to the observation deck is ~CAD30.  The extra CAD25 definitely justified the meal.  The service was decent and we did not feel rushed.  The server took a very nice picture of us with the view behind us, which beats the fake picture they want you to take before entering the restaurant.  My fiancé ordered the steam mussels (huge portion but lack flavor), steak (overcooked, his medium rare order was more like medium well), and mango sorbet (very fruity and huge portion).  I got the seafood chowder (good mix of ingredients but the soup was lukewarm), pork chop (juicy and highly recommended), and pecan tart (another great choice)."
2,"Service - very friendly despite being super busy. You'll have to flag them down every now and than to get some attention for whatever u need, they try to stay on top of things though but it is crazy busy. 

Food - Amazing! Very flavorful. You gotta get the larb. It was so good I forgot to take a picture. They ran out of the grilled banana when we got there and steam bread custard by time we were ready for dessert. Get your dessert and eat it first the moment u get there!

Reservations are a must. It's just crazy busy and we saw people willing to wait in their cars for an hour or getting delivery to go."
2,Honestly we were only considering this place because it was the only patio open . They cited some bullshit rule about not being able to tie your dog up on the patio. Whatevs. So many better places in the hood which are more accommodating to our four-legged friends.
2,"I passed by this place because i was craving a doner after reminiscing about berlin, where i had my first initiation to this wonderful dish. High ratings led to high expectations which ultimately led to mild dissapointment. The doner wasnt bad by any means but this was not even close to the doner i had in berlin. Customer service was good and the place is very small so you have to take it to go. I do not think toronto has any good doner places, the quest continues to find one......"
2,"Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Came here with my partner. She is Hungarian, so we thought to check it out. It was actually my first time having Hungarian food. I got the Chicken Paprikash, and she got the schnitzel. We were both fairly disappointing. The food wasn't horrible, but we both found it a bit underwhelming. The portion sizes were fairly large and decent which I appreciated, and the service was wonderful. Our server was very friendly. But the food itself was meh. Me and her most likley wont be coming back. Again, it wasn't bad.... but I would rather save my $ and spend it on a place I know is tastier, or try a new place out. I feel bad writing this for the owners, like I said, the service was very friendly and the portions were great, but the food we found underwhelming. Just to get an idea, i ended up making my own chicken paprikash at home eventually with some thighs, legs, Hungarian paprika, etc. and it was much tastier... Their spaetzle was better than the one I made though at least! :P 

I hope that the food gets a bit better, and maybe I will visit again. I liked the place, but sadly we didn't enjoy the food as much."
1,"Last week my boyfriend and I checked out Hokkaido. 
I liked this restaurant for quite a few different reasons, good location, quiet, good food and quick service. This place is located at mount pleasant and eglinton which is not far from our house which is a plus, they also have free underground parking Which is another bonus.  We came for a light lunch, and I was surprised to see the price was only 11.99, which was nice because most sushi places run around $12-15 for the same type of selection (plus parking). Aside from us, the place was pretty empty. There was one other family and one other single lady. It seemed strange but it was actually quite refreshing considering how most other AYCE sushi joints in Toronto are usually packed full, even at lunch (akkaido). We ordered dynamite roll, California roll, sweet potato tempura avocado roll, and vegetable tempura. It all came quickly and the presentation was nice. They were smaller rolls with less rice which is exactly what I was looking for. The tempura pieces were also very large. 
They staff was very nice and friendly and encouraged us to order more, unlike other places I've been to that give you less and forget your order. I didn't feel rushed at all. 4/5"
2,"Best nachos in the city, Hands down 
Christopher- thanks for the awesome experience and for the pen!"
2,"Great place to watch a game! Lots of beers - however, no sour options :(

The high tops don't have a hook, so ladies, it might be better to sit at the bar, or in the booth, if you want to set your purse down! 

We ordered the Pear and Walnut salad, the Fish and Chips (sub cheese fries instead), and it was all really tasty.

We didn't expect the fish to be so large, so that was a great surprise! If you love jalapeños, the cheese goes well with it on the fries! Lots of walnuts came with the salad. It tasted nice and fresh!"
2,"Hearty, Italian comfort food made with great care and tradition.  Taverniti is a rare find in an age where food can be more style than substance. The excellent, family restaurant reminds me of what I grew up with in Brooklyn.  The staff was very friendly.  We were treated to a table-side visit by Rosina, the family matriarch - a wonderful lady who clearly loves her food and for others to enjoy it.

Bruschetta were fresh and well seasoned with lightly toasted bread.  Polpette were delicious and served in fresh, tangy marinara.  My only nit - the meatballs could have been larger.

My friends ordered the rigatoni bolognese and spaghetti which they liked very much.  The veal parmigiana with penne marinara was excellent.  Just the right amount of cheese, tender veal.  Perfect.  The three were hearty portions.  Good chanti framed our meal. 

I shall return next time in Toronto!"
1,"I walked into this location looking for a decent bite and a quick meal. I ordered the small burrito with chicken with everything on it. When ordering the employee asked if I wanted mild or hot sauce. I said I'd take the hot sauce, and she warned me it was extremely spicy. I said I would still want it.

After getting the burrito, it was pretty standard fare. It's reasonably priced at $8, and the portion was fair. It was exactly what I had wanted at the moment, but if I want some better food I would go somewhere else."
2,"I don't like this place. I tried to get into it. I tried to like it, I really did. I just couldn't do it.

Lets talk about the decor. What decor. How do I even explain this. It's a big old house, with many rooms. Each room is decorated differently, with it's own bar. It's thrown together feeling, and ramshackle. It just felt really cheap and tacky, I really couldn't get into it.

I didn't eat at this place. I wasn't brave enough. Instead my friends and I enjoyed some drinks. The bartender wasn't surrounded by that many people, maybe 12. He was really inattentive and slow. I understand he was solo, but it's not like he was swamped. 

While I was at the Madison, I forgot what women look like. Never have I seen a place filled with so many guys. Upon leaving I saw a woman on the street, at first I wasn't sure what she was.... thanks Madison Pub. 

I guess this is a good place to go if you want to get really drunk with a bunch of dudes.

On a more recent development I got to speak with one of the owners. I am impressed by how much they care about their establishment, and are willing to listen, take criticism, and improve accordingly. The way a business owner should be."
1,"QUALITY HAS DROPPED

I've been eating here since the 90s, the quality has dropped since the last 2 years. The cheesecake was frozen and not creamy and decadent like it used to be. The portions have gotten smaller.  They've started doing too many things and instead of doing a few things and doing them well . 

You can eat under $10 here which is pretty good, but doesn't mean the quality has to bad.  

The cheesecake I ate was overpriced for the quality, frozen, thin crust and too small a portion.  It was  supermarket quality."
2,"Love Blaze pizza! It's quick and you can't beat the fresh-out-of-the-oven taste. We usually end up here after shopping at Eaton Centre or watching a movie at Cineplex and it's a lot more fun to load up a pie with some fresh, healthy ingredients than to eat the food court dishes nearby."
2,"This place offers two menus AYCE or per order. Came with husband and kids, we went for AYCE

It's $21 for adults $11.99 for kids and $6.99 for toddler/preschool 
The service was bad really rude servers, but the sashimi and sushi rolls were really good. 
Sashimi was fresh doesn't taste frozen like a lot of other AYCE places.
Our fav was the green dragon roll. The eel was tasty and the avocados were fresh. 

Dessert menu was limited about 4 different ice cream Flavours. 

Will come back, hopefully catch them on a good day!"
2,"I absolutely LOVE the ambience of the restaurant. It feels like I'm sitting at an artist's alley cafe with all the string lights, polished wooden tables, paintings, and dim lighting. I was here on a Monday night to try the  Summerlicious Dinner~$25

Pulled Pork Taco (Soft Tortilla, Avocado, Pico De Gallo, Marinated Cabbage) - It's exactly what you expect it to be like, but better :)

Wild Mushroom & Lentil Shepherd's Pie (with Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Mushroom Gravy) - the mashed potatoes are really fluffy and buttery. I wish there was more of it since most of the dish was filled with lentils. I don't really like lentils but they made it work well in the shepherd's pie.

Burnt Marshmallow Ice Cream Smore - THIS IS A MUST TRY. ENOUGH SAID. IT'S LIKE HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH.

Overall, I had a pleasant experience. The only reason why I took out a star was because our waiter made a rude remark to me (that I assumed was meant to be a joke) but actually kinda stung, and it's been engraved into this restaurant's Summerlicious memory, unfortunately. I think out of the 2 of us that went, the waiter didn't know I was going to be the one paying for the meal hence their initial justification for the \""harmless\"" jab. Regardless, the food at insomnia was impressive!"
2,It's all about the ginger fish! A 25 min wait but well worth it and never disappointing. Everything I've had in my countless visits in this Toronto staple makes me happy
2,Beautiful setting. Extremely slow and inefficient service -- coffee took 30 mins to come and they came long after dessert was finished. We ordered Earl Grey Fondue. It was underwhelming. We are quite disappointed overall...
2,"This place has really great, fresh sushi. The fish is delicious, there is not too much rice, everything is done just right. The prices are standard. I used to live in Koreatown North, and thought I had the best sushi in town. Sushi Karu is better than the sushi I had in North York and Willowdale by far!

The staff was super friendly too. We will definitely be coming back!"
2,Came here for drinks on a lazy Saturday. The owner served us and made *amazing* cocktails. Margarita with muddled pineapple is heaven. Service was excellent.  We will be back for food!
2,"We tried the fried chicken and jerk chicken. It came with rice and beans as well as coleslaw. The chicken was so good! Nice spice to it! After reading some reviews it sounded like it might not have enough spice to it but when we ate it we were pleasantly surprised. There was a great kick to the chicken. The chicken was so moist unlike some other jerk chicken places and seasoned perfectly. The chicken pieces were good cuts and not fatty. We also tried the Beef patty.  Excellent!  They only had mild so would love to try a medium. 
I didn't know what this place was when driving by and looked it up to know it was Caribbean food. I agree with the review here that says that a sign showing that it's Carribean food would be beneficial! We will be back!"
1,"Without a doubt this is one of the best Mexican places in Toronto, especially in this price range. I've been going regularly since they opened, and it really reminds me of the taquerias in California more than anything. Easily better than Burrito boyz, big fat burrito, etc.

They don't keep much of the meats prepared, which means that more often than not it's cooked to order. They offer 3 types of tortillas iirc and 4+ types of beans. The meat options are also plentiful, and vegetarian orders get pickled onions + jalapenos. The guacamole is worth adding as well, in my opinion.

The sauce bar is well stocked as well - there's tons of variety and the best part is they're all good.

The dessert section of a taqueria is usually pretty overlooked but I strongly recommend the dulche de leche cake and the dessert nachos if you're looking for a little extra. The horchata is definitely worth trying as well."
2,"Their Bangkok rolls are probably the best I've ever had.  Very fresh, flavorful with varied textures. These contain chicken; I'm usually more fond of vegetable rolls. But these were amazing. My entree - chicken with cashew nuts was flavorful and spicy. I would order that again. But the rolls were stellar. I only wish that I lived in Toronto."
2,"When I say Hemingways you say Yuppies: Hemingways!.... 
No one? really? Alright then...

Yes, Hemingways is a yuppie hangout spot. I think they breed them here, in the back, near the kitchen. There's reason for this, besides it being in the middle of Yorkville it has a great yuppie patio. It's on the third floor so you can always be looking down at people, yuppie style.

They also serve decent yuppie food. Their fried calamari is probably the best I've had in Toronto. Their fries are also delicious, reminiscent of KFC fries done right (you know, with those crunchy bits attached).

The Brunch menu is nothing special however, very plain, very sandwich and breakfast platter oriented. Not creative but nothing to complain about either.  

So why do I like this place? Well... I'm a yuppie. The crowd is yuppie-ish with a dash of student here and there. It's a casual setting for a relaxing night after a long week. Nothing beats a yuppie patio, yuppie beer, and a nice yuppie breeze on a summers day.

HEAT LAMPS ARE HERE FOR THE THE FALL!"
2,"I've picked up the friend chicken sandwich now for takeout twice. It is really good! I love a good chicken sandwich and this one hangs with the best of them. Nice and crispy, every bite is a crunch. The fries are also really good. Going to become a regular part of my lunch rotation for sure."
3,"Portion was god awful. Especially for the hefty price. You're better off going to another poke place in town. The smaller of the two sizes was TINY and they don't even fill it up. They leave 1/4 of the bowl to be filled with things like furikake and wasabi beans......that is not acceptable. I paid $13/$14 so you can at least fill the tiny bowl. Furikake is meant to be a GARNISH. Not 1/4 of my bowl. Very not impressed.

Only reason I gave 2 star instead of 1 was that the food was decent......"
1,"I'm vegan and love this place!  Thirteen dollars gets you a HUGE amount of food.  The bowls are massive, and with so many components to it, you get a different flavour profile in every bite.  The ingredients are always fresh.  Sammiches and salad bowls are terrific.  The staff is always friendly.

The cupcakes are a disappointment though.  Not very flavorful and extremely dense.  I haven't had any of the other deserts; I rarely have any room left, the portions are massive."
2,"I have always loved coming here, my father brought me the first time probably about 8 years ago, always got the hot and sour soup and general chows chicken on rice or the sesame beef. But the past year and a half since the business has been sold it's been awful the beef greasy. The chicken too chewy and gummy. But yesterday topped it all off, went to order out to give it one last chance and saw two cockroaches, one right on the hot food counter and the other practically ran over the guys hand at the cash and he didn't flinch!!! I told them to cancel my order and left immediately...."
2,"The pistachio chocolate chip cookie is amazing. They have different cookies, deli, jam, and most importantly bread.

Very spacious bakery, which is joyful even to walk in."
2,"So bland, I thought I bit into my finger.
Talk about underwhelming flavours. I'm not sure if they just forgot to season every element of the burrito, or if they felt cardboard inspired burritos were going to be a big hit. Save your money and go elsewhere, and if I haven't convinced you and you still want to try it...walk on over to your bookshelf, grab yourself an old book and take a nice bite out of any side. You'll get the same great taste and experience without the disappointment that comes with terrible food you were excited to try moments ago. Not to mention the money and time saved."
2,Rude servers. Guy server kept coming to our table and kept picking up my boss' beer by the mouth of the bottle. So disgusting! They rushed us and told us someone else was waiting for the our table.
2,"I go back and forth with this restaurant all the time as their menu seems to change with every trip I make there. They used to have some amazing salads I would rave about, but I haven't seen them in a while. They've also had a couple great apps, cauliflower and lettuce wraps included. Service is consistent and this location specifically has a beautiful layout which makes it the perfect place for drinks and apps with friends."
2,"While coming back from Distillery District today I realized that Cluck Clucks was just a few steps away. It was on my bookmarks list very long so thought to give it a shot today.

When you are a couple 100 meters away from the restaurant you can smell the delicious fried chicken, so just follow the aroma and you will land in the right place.As you enter you see a very casual atmosphere with a few tables up for grabs. 

We ordered a Cluck Yeah!! Combo with a side of fries and 2 pc fried chicken with a side of wedges.
Fried chicken was mind-blowing, super juicy and crispy, very well seasoned and perfectly cooked. 
Clucks Yeah sandwich again the chicken was super flavourful, tender, juicy and cooked to perfection but for my waffle I would prefer it a little bit more in the savoury side. It was a little sweet for me though I don't think they put lots of sugar in it. However my preference for a chicken waffle sandwich is no sugar at all.

Apart from that everything was superb. Will come back whenever I am around."
1,"As I venture out in the frigid cold in search of the little mom and pop (plus kids) food joints in the area,  several coworkers mentioned this spot

$5 gets you a chicken lunch (choose your chicken style) with coleslaw,  peas and rice and big smiles

At these prices happy diners stumble in for warmth and fine island tunes on the stereo and it is warm in here

Yes the family cooks here.....

They offer patties,  roti and a daily soup but most lune up politely for the lunch special

They make a delicious plantain side so squirting on some hot sauce will delight your lips and tongue

Enjoy the sunny island lifestyle during lunch and that mound of paperwork at the office will be forgotten as you tuck in

Oh easy on the hot sauce....they laugh when you ask how many scotch bonnet peppers are used?  Is a secret Mon! !!"
1,"Now I know that the Japanese/ Korean cuisine is not a new concept, but the area was in need of a Korean  menu (Otherwise you would have to go all the way up to Steeles to get your fix).

Our visit was around 1pm Saturday and the place was half full. Upon entry we were greeted by a lovely young lady who was attentive for the duration of our meal.

We order 2 pork bone soup, salmon sashimi salad and a kamikaze roll. Everything was delicious; (I felt they could have been more generous with the portion of the salmon sashimi). The meal came with a side appetizer which was \""meh\"". No complaints about the service,  quality of food or pricing. 

I will be back again very soon.  Just sorry I didn't try this place out sooner!"
2,Their honey madeleines was the perfect sweetness and their cheesecake was soft and delicious
2,"Brown rice green milk tea - DONE. 

Four stars because of selection and ability to customize ice and sweetness. Love that you can get a bigger size."
2,"Yummy! I live in NYC and travel here for work often. I've eaten here 3 times so far and have plans to go again for lunch today. I tried to order delivery to my hotel but because they were out of ginger ale my order was cancelled so I ended up walking over to pick it up. The server suggested a coconut water drink that was delicious and quite refreshing and the food was ready in 15 min! The place is clean, fast, and the servers that I've had have all been friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I tend to go for the Mee Kati with a shrimp appetizer and haven't been disappointed but I think I'll try something new today. Or not. It's that good!"
2,"I'm a huge fan of jamie oliver's, and when I found myself in toronto on a trip, I had to go try jamie's italian despite all the bad reviews. Well turns out I really shouldn't have ignored the reviews... As much as I love and admire jamie, this restaurant is worse than my cooking...
In particular, my prawn pasta was made with very fishy and un-fresh dead prawns and overcooked spaghetti, I really couldn't bring myself to eat more than half the plate.
Everything else was just mediocre, and service wasn't horrible, but I can't bring myself to say any good things about my waitress either. 
Oh jamie... I think this restaurant is better off closed."
2,"We ordered food from here and it was ok. Their portions are big! So you can probably have some leftovers. The noodles were nice and the spicy tofu was ok but everything else (especially the fried tofu) was kind of bland and meh. Probably wouldn't order from here again but if I did, I'd get the fried noodles."
2,"Was here for Saturday brunch...  Food was good, pastry was great!
Definitely do this again."
1,"What a great experience compared to a not so good experience at O&B Canteen.  See my reviews for details.  Anyway, stopped by here before the Rod Stewart concert for dinner.  Restaurant was busy with pre concert and pre theatre crowd but service was impeccable.  Food was delicious and very reasonably priced.  I had the salmon entree and loved every bite.  I'll definitely come back to this O&B."
1,"I ordered the family combo and it's amazing! Well cooked and really tasty, it includes salad, rice, potatoes and a whole chicken just for 23 (taxes included). Totally recommended!"
1,"this place is really good and very consistent, never dealt with a male server here though before. the price makes this place even more attractive and every dish is made fresh. unlimited refills on the apps and rice and tea without charge. always a line-up too for some reason -1 for the flies"
2,Why are the falafels not kept behind glass? This was my go to lunch until I found a nice curly hair stuck to one in my meal. Disgusted and will not return
2,"WOW I'm impressed! I had a craving for Thai food but most of the Thai places are a bit far from my area. Then I found this place that I had no idea was around the corner from me and had great reviews. 
I decided to stop in and it was really busy with all tables occupied and a line up for take out and Uber Eats drivers. 
I ordered Chicken Satay and Chicken Pad Thai Spicy and the gentleman working the front was very friendly and polite. I took a seat on the ledge near the window to wait for my food and surprisingly it only took about 15 minutes and it was ready. 
When I got home the food was still nice and hot and they even wrapped the satay in foil to keep it warm. 
The meat was tender and delicious with nice peanut sauce for dipping. 
The Chicken Pad Thai was fantastic with just the right amount of chicken and spicy with a generous portion of crushed peanuts and bean sprouts. 
Overall I'm very impressed with this restaurant and the service I received. 
I will most certainly be going back here for lunch, dinner, and take out. 
I was so hungry I almost forgot to take a picture of my Pad Thai so it's a 3/4 eaten photo...lol."
2,"The restaurant is now called 'Hashi Izakaya'- same amazing food, menu, and service!"
2,"Awesome little place!   (Awesome and little both being key words!).

Amazing mac & cheese.  I could have eaten 2 dishes of it.   My hubby had the bahn mi sandwich and enjoyed it, but didn't rave about it like I did with the mac & cheese.  He also had the roasted root salad to start, and although I wasn't going to have any, I'll admit that we both really enjoyed that.  The dressing was delish.  Hubby liked the beer options, because he discovered Duggan's Brewery beer, which he'd never had before.

We were disciplined and didn't have dessert, but everything looked good.   

Atmosphere was quaint, cute, love the mismatched china... as others have said, it's very West Queen West, but in the Financial District.   I love the defied boundaries!  Service was okay.   Not oozing with niceties, but not rude either.

I just want some more mac & cheese........."
2,"A nice change in bloor west that stands out from your typical Korean restaurants.  Really neat grungy decor inside, similar to other playa cabanas... but a warning if you're dining in winter - it is freezing inside... do ask for a table in the back!

You order off the wall menu, which depending where you sit can be hard but fun.  We shared a number of appetizers.  Standouts for me were the salmon ceviche and the calamari.  The ceviche almost has a sweet taste to it.  The guacamole was also very good and you get an unlimited supply of chips.  I passed on the entrees and went with a few tacos - go for the kampungki chicken and yuzu tuna.  I had the spicy carnita and it was entirely too spicy for me to taste anything.  Otherwise, the tacos are on par with general electric and la carnita.

We also had a few of the cocktails.  The name escapes me but the one with ginger beer was delicious. There was a sour one as well (kimchi sour maybe?) that tasted like I was drinking lime juice.

I'd say the korean influence is lacking a bit, aside from a spin on korean ribs and adding kimchi to a few things.  Still, there is a bit of an asian touch to most dishes, which is an interesting fusion with Mexican food."
2,"I was absolutely blown away by the overall design and concept of this cafe. I love it!

Ordered the HK waffles with ice cream (chocolate and mango), and nutella filled waffle. Their food was average- nothing too amazing. 

Personally, was amazed more at their interior design than the food they had to offer. Yes the food was exotic and wild; but most just seemed like it was designed by a 3y/o who was putting in as much sugar components as possible.

Other than the food, it's definitely worth a try! I will stop by again if I'm by because the desserts were good."
2,"My first meal and first poutine in TO/Canada and I wasn't satisfied. Perhaps I didn't order the right thing but although the braised beef poutine was tasty, the beef could be softer and fries more crispy."
2,"Seven Lives Tacos Y Mariscos started out as a pop-up shop founded by Sean Riehl, but has since become a dominant force to be reckoned with in Kensington Market. Small crowds of people consistently line up here for a taste of Baja-style taco goodness on a daily basis.The Gobernador is one of the main draws, featuring smoked tuna, cheese, and scrumptious grilled shrimp. The whole taco lineup is quite stellar, to be honest.

A cash-only policy and limited seating aren't enough to discourage hungry Seven Lives fanatics. Background music and chatter among patrons and the friendly, outgoing staff here make for sufficient amusement while you anxiously await your order. 

Fresh ingredients and flamboyant flavour combinations make for a delicious meal that is hard to rival in the city. Tacos are approximately $5 each, and just two will fill a lot of space in your tummy. Spicy salsa is available and it's also quite good. You must try this place out at least once, whether you're from the city or just visiting."
2,Worst service....I ordered the new poutine dish.  It was great but the service was really bad!!!!! Will keep going to our favourite location on Dundas/Shorncliffe.  Nearly empty and a couple waiting for 7 mins to be seated...yes we timed it!
2,"They've been around forever, tells you a lot!  Always excellent food, the quality is superb, but there's always a long wait for a table... go during down times... if you're looking for casual with great wood fired pizza's and perfectly dressed salads... this is the place!  Ingredients are top notch."
2,"Love love love this place.  We went on a Monday.  The waitresses are super friendly.  The ambiance is very upscale and unique. This chain from Vancouver made its way to TO just  about a month ago.  

We went pretty late at night around 11pm.  They were still serving food.  We sat by the open patio.  I swear we had 5 homeless guys walk by and one asking for food. 

The food is pretty good. The best thing on the menu i was told by the waitress Kat is the Tuna Ahi Burger.  The lightly seared tuna was topped with crispy deep fried onion rings, a pepper aoli, and some other sauces that I could not make it.  It is like a piece of heaven in your mouth.  The flavors exploding in your mouth as you try to figure out what ingredients were so astutely put together to create this food-gasmic experience.

We also ordered the chicken Flat bread which is also very tasty.

I would definitely venture back. For the friendly waitresses if not the food."
1,"Ding! It's all in the timing. In life. In going to The Red Room. 

Go ahead, choose a school's in session weekend night. See how that goes. More chairs than square footage within a place crammed full of students and I'm sure, yes, you have something to knit pick. Or go ahead, choose New Year's night. Whether you're a nerd looking to find just the right table, parents catching up with their daughter for a casual dinner, or a three set of friends looking to commiserate in a booth, this is the type of night where the Red Room will surprise you in being a sturdy parliament of wine-sipping that's easy on the dimes. 

Carafe. Wine. A litre. $18. 6+ glasses. 3 people, and I'm a lightweight, so do the math (and you other 2 can go ahead and heel click). On a quiet night there's room enough for a multicultural choir who rolls 14 deep, and a nerd date to pick just the right booth, and for us to spastic-ally spout off vulgar witticisms. Hello, time traveling worm holes you don't have to over think to find! Take that, Hawking. 

Now. You're going to remain skeptical of my positive review of this place. You'll say, what kind of Yelp review doesn't mention food and service. You don't need to care about either of those. You need to care about a booth, more mirrors than a stripper's green room, and the cheapest bottled wine you can find outside of a box. But. Yes. It's all in the timing. In life. In going to The Red Room. Ding!"
1,"This is one of my favourite sushi spots in the city - especially for lunch! 
The butter yaki maki roll is so, so, so good. A little bit on the mayo-y side but I love the torched deliciousness. 

For lunch, I usually get the butter yaki maki + mango avocado roll and it comes with a soup + choice of drink (they serve illy coffee/pop/green tea) - for only $6.95 + tax!!

It's a nice sit down area if you have more time."
2,"came here because I've been craving a good proper English breakfast for so long but I got here a bit late and arrived in time for their 5:30 dinner time. The atmosphere is really relaxing and welcoming, cute english decor. The menu makes my mouth water; from Indian English fusions to traditional big brunch plates... I had the cauliflower and cheese pie, one of the only few vegetarian choices. Nonetheless, it was delicious. Served with tasty, traditional mushy peas, gravy and chunky, thick chips. I will definitely be back for a good hangover breakfast cure!"
2,"Came here at one of their busier times, on a Sunday afternoon for dim sum with my mother and boyfriend. The restaurant was packed but we were acknowledged promptly and seated within 10 minutes. The food came quickly and tasted pretty good. 

Another tables orders kept coming to our table after all our food had arrived but the staff were quick to rectify the situation. The service could have been faster but for such a high volume time of the day, the service was still pretty good. 

6 plates of dim sum and 3 plates off the chef's special came up to about $55. We left with our bellies satisfied.

The owners also own a grocery store in the same plaza."
2,"Terrible.  I would never go again - no excuses.
The server put down napkins and chopsticks in one pile.  He didn't bring dishes for soy sauce which I had to fetch myself as he wasn't around.  For 2 people he gave one menu even though there was a pile of them by the cash.  He did give 2 all-you-can-eat menus and a drinks menu though.  I should have known that if they served all-you-can-eat, the quality would suffer for it...
I ordered a dragon roll (unagi, cucumber, avocado).  There was almost no unagi and the little that was there was not fresh.  The dragon roll was mostly cucumber and rice.  I spoke to the fellow who makes the rolls showing him there was almost no unagi and he said \""that is standard\"".  He told me he used \""three pieces\"".  The pieces must have been about the size of postage stamps or smaller, and two of them were only bits of skin.  
Not \""standard\"" in any other Japanese restaurant I have ever eaten in.
My friend had chicken teriyaki and was (after a long wait) brought a rectangular plate with strips of chicken in sauce on it.  Nothing else.  She asked if it came with anything else like rice.  The server enquired in the kitchen and eventually brought a bowl of rice.  Nothing else was included for $11. - not a vegetable, a green leaf, nothing.
For an order of a dragon roll with almost no unagi, a small plate of chicken strips, bowl of rice and order of gyoza we were billed $27.
When I objected to the lack of quality, and the lack of unagi the fellow shrugged and said \""this is how we do it - this is standard\"".  Not even an apology.  Not even any concern...
There are LOTS of Japanese restaurants in Toronto.  I recommend walking past this one or going across the street and trying something worth paying for.  What a waste of money!!!"
2,"BEST Pad Thai I've ever had...I was hesitant to order it because this isn't a Thai restaurant so I wasn't sure if it would be good. I'm so glad I decided to go for it because I still compare all of the Pad Thais I've had since then to this one and it's been TWO years since I had it. Full of meat, full of flavor and just full of goodness in general. If you go for dinner and you like Pad Thai or hell even if you don't... def order it and you'll LOVE it!

Only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the service was a little slow"
2,"Uh... It's a pho place.  Take it or leave it - I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here because it is just so... meh.  I honestly think I've been here before, but I just cannot recall.

The fresh rice paper rolls were fresh as you would expect.  The small is for 2 rolls and the large is 4.  The pho is alright.

This stretch of Kennedy is full of warehouses and furniture and electronic shops, so this restaurant might be an option for a quick meal after a day spent shopping."
2,"The theme is great! It's worth going for the experience, 90's music, Saved By The Bell on TV, my drink came in a beaker and our bill was a report card. The patio is awesome and their is plenty of seating. 

If you are hungry, don't get the Krispy Crunch French Toast. It's disappointing and you leave feeling hungry despite it being huge. It's really more of a desert than a brunch item.

Despite my experience, I still recommend this place, we had a great time! Your conversation will never be dull because the place is filled with conversation starters (perfect for a first date)."
2,The place is awesome. Had the fish and chips with the caesar salad with almond crusted chicken. The patio is more casual looking and feeling than the Jack Astors patio. The staff if really friendly and the crowd is a young working crowd. The dessert we got as a great for being first timers which is always an incentive to try the place out. They also had the steigl Rader which I find hard to find for a restaurant that provides it. The dessert was a brownie like square. It was really sweet and filling.
3,"Actually a very good contender to the infamous Sushi Bong just a bit south.  They are a bit more expensive but their sushi has less rice and more of the good filling.

Their green dragon roll is good since they give a good amount of avocado.

I like their orange sauce they provide with their sushi."
2,"Awesome food (I especially like the crab cakes and brick chickens), great beer selection and really helpful, professional staff."
1,"I tried the Power Up breakfast. It comes with eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon and sausage for $5.99. It's a ton of food for the price which is great. What isn't great is that the food itself is pretty brutal. Other than the eggs, everything else seemed like it had been sitting for a few hours before it made it to my take-out container. The potatoes were cold, the bacon was cold, the sausage looked like a shriveled prune.  Overall just really bad. 

I would suggest getting something else on the breakast menu as the rest seems to be made in front of you when you order it.

November challenge 2/30"
3,"We came for dinner, arrived around 9pm on a Saturday night, and the place was almost empty. The staff were lovely, nice local beer selection, but I paid $26 for a steak and it tasted really 'off', the general consensus was that it tasted barn-y/like goat cheese. it was so so disappointing, especially at that price point, even among the 4 of us we left much of it uneaten...I feel nauseous just thinking about it. The Mac and Cheese was watery and flavourless. The baked beans were good but very heavy on the maple syrup. Coleslaw was fine... Onion rings were fine.... Ribs were probably the best of the dishes we had at a 4/5, chop sandwich was also pretty good, but overall we weren't impressed."
1,"I enjoyed this place. The food was good, and not too pricey. I had the fish and savoury bread pudding, which was very satisfying, and something I'd never tried prior. I also had the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream and it was delicious, but I'd like to note that the ice cream tasted a bit freezer burnt, but everything else was delicious, so I'm willing to look beyond the one slip up. It was pretty busy, but we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. The place was also packed with tables and pretty loud, but I enjoyed it. The noise level made it so that you didn't have to hear the intimate conversations of those around you.
I'll be back!"
2,"If your looking for Shawerma or middle eastern food than this is definitely the wrong place. This place should serve hard shell tacos with the dinners and rename the place The Taco Guys because it tastes exactly like a taco salad with rice. 
Save your time, money and colon....what a disappointment. Fake hype"
1,"I was passing by with a friend and decided to check out some fruits. The shop is small but enough to get the essential. The price is really cheap at high quality compared to chain groceries like Metro and Loblaws. It's Chinese New Year, so they are selling some mini tangerines with leaves. Wish they would sell some bigger ones for big fortune. End up buying some green grape only."
2,"Fantastic restaurant! This was my first time here and was very pleased.   I have had Pakistani food before and this was by far the best Chicken Karahi ever.   The naan was also beyond fresh as it must have been under a minute from the tandoor to the table.   

I did expect a higher spice level but that was in no way a negative.  

The byriany was good.  I have had better but I did not come for that... I came for the Kahari.    

The service was friendly and welcoming.   

Highly recommended."
2,Amazing food and environment. They could definitely do something about the reesrvation/waiting process. They give wait times that are never accurate and need to incorporate reservations for large groups.
2,"Overall we had a good experience at Alleycatz but it's a bit of an unusual spot. We decided to take advantage of their summerlicious menu and enjoy the live music band while we were there.

The first two courses on the summerlicious menu were quite good. Tasty, well-prepared, and went down easily. The dessert was unfortunately really disappointing. On the menu it was listed as \""New York Style Cheesecake\"" which it certainly was not - it was more like a no-bake cheese cake with a rather unusual creamy flavour; nothing like the dense, wonderful New York cheesecake I was excited to eat. 

The band was decent - spent the evening playing their versions of covers and we have a good time on the dance floor for a couple songs. We did find ourselves waiting for quite a while to dance, hoping for a song that really got our feet moving, but it never came. So we got up and danced after a couple of drinks and made the most of the evening anyway. Honestly, I probably will go back for other live bands, but hopefully they will improve upon their dessert options."
3,"I passed by this place on my way home with my boyfriend while debating on what we should have for dinner. The place looked nice so we thought we'd try it out, since we're both sushi lovers. I ordered a few rolls and the giant ebi shooter - I thought the rolls were all very mediocre, but the ebi shooter was pretty darn delicious. However, overall, I didn't think the food was worth the price, but the food was nowhere near as bad as our rude waitress. I don't think I'll ever return to give it a second shot."
2,"It's a Tim Hortons, and not a very big one. This one can get pretty busy during rush coffee hours. I like the big, bright windows at this location. Good to people watch while getting dat double double fix."
2,"My favourite place for poke bowls now!

I was downtown running errands and knew I had to visit H2 myself. My yelp elite friend shared some Thai curry soup + soba with me last month and I enjoyed this unique combination and taste a lot! 

Since it was my first time here, Nick (owner) walked me step by step. For the poke bowls, you can choose sushi rice, brown rice or soba for the base. I ordered myself the spicy salmon bowl, with soba as the base. Ingredients were very fresh!! I just didn't like all the onions. Bowl was devoured instantly, and I was given a fruit to finish off my meal. I chose an orange over the apple, which was very sweet! I was comfortably full and had the much needed energy to finish up my errands.

There's also a VIP card for $5. If you frequent here a lot, I suggest getting it. It'll give you instant discounts to their poke bowls and hot bowls.

I would come here more, if only Nick opens a poke restaurant uptown... hint hint."
2,"A few days ago Dealicious had a deal on their site: $13 for $26 worth of food at Megas Restaurant.  I love Greek food (a couple of years ago I went to Greece, one of the main reasons so I could enjoy the food there), so I bought myself a coupon.  As it turned out,  I had a lousy time at Megas.

First - I needed to use the ladies room.  It stank.  Then I discovered my stall didn't have a lock on it.   A couple of the machines on the wall were out of order as well.

Second - I asked the waitress if the salad that came with my moussaka was a regular sized salad.  She said \""yes\"".  In fact, when it arrived, I saw that it was a small salad. 

Third - my moussaka was lukewarm.  That's not such a bad deal, but it really wasn't anything special.  More like bar food.  (To be perfectly fair, the sign outside the restaurant says that they specialize in seafood dishes.  Maybe if I had the calamari, this review may not have hit your screen like it is doing now.)

On top of this, the waitress hadn't asked me if I wanted rice or potatoes with the meal (the menu said I had my choice). By the time she had come to my table I wasn't thinking of this, it took her a while to get to me, and during that time, my mind had drifted.   When my dish arrived it just had the rice on it.   I had  wanted the potatoes.

Fourth - I ordered the yoghurt with honey for dessert.  I had had this before at another restaurant, which tasted like heaven.  Liking it so much, I had started to buy President's Choice Greek Yoghurt for at home.  It doesn't come close to that ambrosia I had on the Danforth.  The yoghurt at Megas tasted like the store-bought, except that it had real honey drizzled over it.  

Fifth - I was overcharged on the salad as well as on the yoghurt.  I thought I was overcharged on the wine too, but was informed that the price I saw online ($6) for a glass of wine was not the same as the in-restaurant menu ($7).

Needless to say, I have learnt my lesson.  I now see all sorts of negative reviews on-line for this restaurant.  And so, the next time I see a great deal on a coupon, I will carefully read the reviews before deciding to buy."
1,"Went for a Saturday lunch.  Ordered the Futo maki california roll lunch and the 10 piece sushi lunch.  Futo maki was packed with a nice amount of spinach. 
  
The lunch came with edamame which was a bonus.

Hosu is a casual sit where you like environment.  The place is clean, the meal came quickly, and for $7.95 per lunch special, it's a steal!  Took some time to get the server's attention for the bill, but if in a rush you can always pay directly at the front, which is what we did.

Also ordered from take out another time and we were just as pleased with the food quality, taste and price.  Just be careful when you order over the phone, it's easy to mix up the Lunch Specials and the Pick up/Take out menu items.  We were told that the latter are a smaller portion and don't come with soup and salad, but they are also a couple bucks cheaper than their Lunch Special counterparts."
2,"Great market with everything a chef would need to make an amazing meal. Spent a good amount of time here like a kid in a candy store! My favorite venders are the specialty meat shops and fruits/vegetable venders. Most memorable purchases are specialty proteins  e.g. boar, venison, ostrich, foie gras, wagyu beef, kobe beef"
2,"I thought it was ok. The service at the front entrance could be a lot better. My husband and I put our names on the waiting list for a seat on the patio and then decided to grab a drink by the bar. For over an hour, we waited for a table and no one called on us. After a while, we decided to ask about our table - apparently the hostess skipped over our name and started seating other people. We complained to management and no one came out to even apologize!

The bartender who served us was great - service by the hostess/ reception need to be greatly improved!

I don't think I would go back - this is the second time that Against The Grain has overlooked us as customers and I would prefer to go to another restaurant where I know that eventually I will get seated!"
2,"The burgers are AWESOME!
The poutine is AWESOME!
The milkshakes are AWESOME!

Absolutely the best burgers I've had in Toronto.  The meat is good and slightly charred, the bun is classic, toppings plentiful and fresh.   I haven't tried the full gamut of different types of poutine they offer, so I have that to look forward to! (Greek poutine???  I can't wait!)

Sides should be shared, as the portions are so huge they're impossible to finish, and trust me, that comes from a man with a big appetite.   Also, be prepared to rush home and lie down after eating."
2,McDonald's is crap. But this one is crap with the worst service you can imagine. So just avoid it.
2,"Little Anthony's was quite a find. It is located squarely in the business/hotel/theater area of Toronto. (We drove, thinking they had parking, but if they did, it was not obvious to us). 

Yelp had a check in special for turkey meatballs, so we got to try them. Everyone enjoyed them. For other appetizers, we had the bacon wrapped dates (I had these other places and I always enjoy), as well as the Caesar salad. Excellent.

Pasta dishes come in tasting sizes and larger sizes, which is perfect if you want to eat lighter. We had the  bolognese, the penne arrabbiata, the chicken parm, and buttered pasta for the younger child. Service was excellent and friendly. I would return. Enjoyed it a lot."
1,"My only regret was coming so late - spontaneously decided to check out Kensington market for lunch only to learn that more than 3/4 of the menu at Rasta Pasta had already sold out! 

The pasta chef was already long gone by the time we arrived, we were told that only jerk chicken panini was left on the pasta side. We luckily scored the last two. On the rasta side, we managed to grab the last order of their ackee and salted cod (only had enough to make us a medium), a jerk chicken dumpling, a large curry goat, and a large jerk chicken with coleslaw, rice and bean. It was a bit hectic scrambling the last orders while various customers attempted to creep up from behind towards the front of the counter. 

There were not a whole lot of space to actually eat inside but we managed to pull together a small table and few chairs. With crammed space and limited air ventilation, we still found ourselves eating with beaming smiles across our face - the food was unbelievable. 

The jerk chicken panini - I'm not a sandwich girl but this will top my fav of all of time. Generous serving of succulent meat smothered in jerk sauce, topped with creamy, crunchy coleslaw, sandwiched between warm, toasty bread. Can't believe this was not sold out sooner! Last menu item in the store? I will take it... All of it! 

Curry goat - aromatic, creamy, and perfectly spiced. The goat was \""fall off the bone, melt in your mouth\"" good. Didn't imagine their coleslaw, rice and bean would pair so well. It certainly proved us wrong. We scraped the bottom of our styrofoam box for the very last grain. 

Ackee and salted cod - their Jamaican pride special - I'd never eaten ackee before but instantly fell in love. The creamy texture and subtle richness - why didn't we meet sooner? I wasn't as crazy about the fish - found it a bit dry. But the ackee itself would be enough to convince me to get this dish again! 

Jerk chicken - more of the amazing chicken that was on my panini. Two legs, one Breast for a large. Can definitely see why their $5 lunch special is a steal (you only get an extra breast for their $12 large). 

Jerk chicken dumpling - I had the image of Chinese styled dumplings filled with jerk chicken when placing the order. Instead i was disappointed by a giant ball of stale dough and very little (dry, crusty) chicken - would definitely recommend saving $3 and skipping this. 

Overall, I vowed to plan my days better so I won't ever again miss out on their pasta and oxtail. If we were eating the \""leftovers\"
2,"Had the misfortune of going to this place for 2 separate social events and it wasn't by choice. Please only go here if you are into Oysters. There are zero vegetarian or poultry selections on the main course menu. This is one of those places which serves only a limited type of customers. Adding a couple of normal dishes to the menu would probably make this place a bit more bearable. Service was average. We were a group of around 10 people and 4 of us couldn't really find anything decent to eat. One of us ordered the trout and viola, it was a whole fish served with eyes and all! Quite disgusting to look at, forget about eating it. Again, adding at least one normal dish to the menu wouldn't kill them. Ended up with the fish and chips which were very greasy but tasted ok. Nothing creative about the chips. They were just damn soggy fries."
2,"This place is now closed. 
It's now called The Hive.
They are having a Kpop dance party on August 17th."
2,It a cozy place with friendly staff and also they are serving good and fresh sushi.if you don't mind smal places it is recommended ;)
2,"I've been coming to Pho Hung for years now when I have a craving. This weekend, I happened to be strolling through the neighbourhood in the rain and decided to go and have some warm soup. Free tea was served without even asking (yay).

They give you a form to fill out for your order. Got the #1 small, for $7.00. Perfect size for one (I probably could have gone one size up). Tripe and all the various cuts of beef were yummy. A few squirts of sriracha and I was in heaven slurping up the broth. 

I like how they give you the bean sprouts, basil and lime on the side. I'm not a fan of bean sprouts (one of the only food that I don't care for!) so it saved me from fishing them out.

Absolute best place in the city for pho? I haven't been to enough places to judge. But it's tasty, quick, great value, and will be in my regular rotation of restaurants for years to come."
2,"1040am on Aug 11th as came to this dim sum spot. We got a number and waited. Our number was called pretty quickly. Only about 5 minute wait. I asked host if pricing was different in the private rooms and she snapped and told me to go where she told me to go and insinuated that I wasn't to ask any questions. Very short tempered, crass and terribly rude. 

The serving staff was much nicer and the food is decent. You mark what you want on the paper  and the serving staff will assist if you need. Ordered shrimp dumplings,  meat and shrimp dumpling  and some noodles rolls. It's piping fresh and high end but it's pretty good. I'd rate it 7 out of 10. The food isn't bad but the woman with a pipe up her ass at the front is miserable and should probably be let go so she doesn't ruin other people's meals before they start."
1,"Really good selection of bento box with reasonable price. I loved the wakame box. It came with a lot of different stuff plus soup, salad and green tea."
2,"There's a live pianist. \""What!?\"" He later became a live guitarist. When we asked, they weren't sure if they're going to keep bringing back beautiful music every night (they absolutely should!). Service was excellent. Despite the dining room only opening a few days before we visited, the friendly server was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and was able to provide recommendations. He also appeared several times to top off water and bring more bread. The food took quite a bit of time to come though, but I was satisfied because it was worth the wait.

The grilled calamari was great. At many places, overcooked calamari will taste tough and rubbery. Here, there was no such thing and it tasted great aside from some flaky burnt bits.

The lamb shank was also good. Very tender, fall-off-the-bone. I think just one or two cuts with the knife was all that was needed to separate the entirety of the meat from the bone. The veggies tasted salty, but I think it's because I let them get mixed into the barbeque-y sauce on the bottom. The mashed potatoes were quite creamy.

The wifi password is 12345678 and the network name is MexicanAmigos (the name of which will apparently change soon!)."
2,"Decent breakfast place, had the duck confit hash, was quite good."
2,"one of my favourite coffee shops in toronto! staff is very friendly. and right now, they're giving away free samples of their apple cider! 

got their specials (forgot the official names):

beet red velvet latte - very appealing but not my cup of tea. to me, it had a strong chocolate flavour and i didn't really taste the flavours of beet or red velvet

ginger matcha latte - OMG! what a flavour combination! strong flavours of ginger and matcha but not overwhleming at all. has a nice kick at the end

and my favourite bakery: kouign amman - think multiple layers of rich buttery croissants rolled into a ball with a hint of sweetness. make sure you get it warmed up! it will be the best thing you'll ever taste!"
2,"The meat was well marinated, I had the chicken. The toppings and hard toco shell tasted as if they came out of an Old El Paso jar. The hard taco shell was dried out as well. Friendly service , but with all the taco places available in Toronto, this one falls short."
1,"2.5 star

Urraca Resto Lounge has been opened since July is still in growing pain. A little confused, a lot of uncertainity from the decoration, the menu and the staffs.

Is it a food place? Is it a drinking place? What's the price point? How to get the crowd in?

As a lounge, Urraca is just too bright with that huge chandelier in this relatively small space. The sofa does feel awkward, maybe I ate too much that it just sagged all the way down. 

Our waitress was definitely confused when I asked for the drink menu. No drink menu? But they can make anything for us? What's the specialities? We can make anything? $3.50 domestic beer is the only thing seems to have a pricing on!

Menu though quite interesting with a Korean fusion twist. But after all they are all deep fried bar grabs just dressed up with Korean ingredients. We shared

Bulgogi Poutine ($7)
- good as snack with generous portion

Kimchi Rice Ball ($7)
- the better dish of the night, crispy outside and mushy inside and quite delicious too
- huge portion!! 

Roast Pork Belly ($10)
- the pork belly were so deep fried that they were rubbery and dry
- roast vs deep fried? maybe they should change the description or just take that off the menu

Urraca does have a lot of potential to be a good place to eat and hang out with friends. Price is good with generous serving. But management really need to step up and at least dim the light, have a drink menu put together and maybe get some beers on draft?!"
3,"Food was just okay. We got the spicy eggplant with bean curd and stir fried veggies. The spicy eggplant was with tofu and was really good. However, the veggies were undercooked and no flavour. Was really hard for me to choose something I wanted since the fake meat contained gluten (I have a gluten allergy). Prices seemed really over priced for what you got. For two main courses with two rice bowls it was $40"
2,"A friend recommended this restaurant while we are in town for trade show. Couldn't get a reservation, so we decided to try our luck. Boy, were we lucky. This is THE BEST dinner I have ever had in Toronto. 
Three of us ordered the lamb ribs, crispy baby artichoke, roasted lamb shoulder, grilled branzino and sweet jeweled rice. Every dish is exquisite and the flavors are on so many level. Definitely coming back to this one again."
2,"This place is a winner when it comes to desserts from the region they represent. I have had a bit of exposure to desserts from this area but am not familiar with some of  the non main stream offerings (more on that later). 
The place is airy and clean in a non descriptive collection of stores and is located in the back so get your directions down before venturing here. There was pouring rain when I walked in and shop was somewhat empty. I immediately eyed the Kanafeh as it was recommended by a YDB as one of the best in the city. I have not had this dessert before so wasn't sure what to expect as hadn't had a chance to read up about it either. They asked whether I wanted it warmed up for eating which is good as I wouldn't have known that was proper way to consume it. 
I was expecting a rush of sugar which is synonymous with desserts from that region. I was pleasantly surprised as the cheese base mellowed out the sweet. Interesting texture and lingering taste of rose essence. An off beat dessert IMO and worth a try if you don't prefer the overly sweet desserts.
I was visiting guests after so I ordered a variety of baklava (mainly pistachio based) for all to try. Hmmm some of these were decent and some overly dry or sweet and didn't hit the spot. I have had better versions of baklava which were home made. Depending on one's penchant for baklava they might do it for you. 
I saw some frozen items as well (take home and bake) and nice variety of haloomi cheese. Decent selection of biscuits as well. 4 Stars IMO for the Kanafeh alone."
2,"Food is good here. Been here few times and had good experiences. I decided to take my mom out for her birthday and we made reservations but had to wait over 10 minutes and all the tables were full. Their excuse was that \""it was a busy night\"". What is the point of making reservations if you're just going to make us wait? Some tables looked like they just sat down and some of those tables were only half full (2 people in 4 people table). They obviously didn't consider the fact that we are coming. Just really annoying."
3,"I came here with a coworker on a work trip to Toronto, and thought it was a cute, fun, hip place. The selection on the menu definitely skews towards the not-as-healthy, so don't expect to stick to a diet when you come here. I'd recommend sharing dishes; we shared 3 appetizers and 1 entree (burger).

Deep Fried Beer Cheese Croquettes ($13) - A bit on the pricey side for basically, 4 cheese sticks, but these are every bit as delicious as they sound. The cheese inside is not gooey and stringy like a mozzarella stick, but instead it's a mix of 3 cheeses. It's a softer texture (simliar to pub cheese), and deep fried to perfection and served with a sweet maple sauce on the side. I'd highly recommend these.

Roasted Beet & Farro Salad ($15) - They took something healthy (beets and farro) and then made it unhealthy by putting it atop cream cheese (yes, my comment about this restaurant being not-healthy rings true with this dish). It was delicious though - the beets were fresh, the farro was crunchy and it had great flavor.

Smoked Trout Dish ($16) - I imagined something much different than this when I ordered it. It reminded me of a coleslaw with a piece of smoked trout on top.  The smoked trout on top was delicious, but the rest was had too much mayo. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't my type of dish.

Sirloin Bacon Cheeseburger ($18) - This came with fries which were good (and slightly sweetened in a good way). The burger was not really one of my favorites. I love burgers, but the patty was disproportionate to the rest of the toppings & bun, and a bit on the thick side so it was hard to eat. They also had too much aioli on the burger, and I didn't end up eating the bun. The patty was too gamey for my liking and on the dry side. I wouldn't get this again.

All in all, I would give this 3.5 stars. Stick to the unhealthy options and I think you'll be fine. The croquettes are a must-have and if I'm back again, I'll try the chicken pot pie. It's a fun place to come with some friends and share a bunch of dishes."
2,"Delicious fried fish sandwich with a house-made bread, tamarind sauce, and shredded  cabbage. Can't wait to come back for dinner."
2,Very cozy atmosphere. The staff was friendly. The experience overall was great. The theme was very warm.
2,"Took a while to get seated, wasn't busy but just short staffed. Was served by a lovely waitress. She was polite, kind and very courteous. She kept checking on or table to see if we needed anything else. We presented her with a coupon at the beginning and usually wait staff loses interest in you at this point, she remained consistent with her demeanour. Great service, restaurant and food were ok. Would return because of her service."
2,"Campagnolo restaurant on Dundas St., West was such a pleasure and a refreshing change from the Torontol scene. It's definitely a destination place and not so much a neighborhood haunt.  They make fresh bread pipping hot and crusty and fresh cultured butter that is served piping hot fresh from the oven. I had the hamachi Crudo (yellowfin tuna flank)  and the red snapper which was crispy on the outside and melting with tenderness and moisture in the inside along with a side of sautéed kale.
The Buratta was served with sautéed grapes and drizzled with this succulent buttery olive oil from Portugal.  The lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare and right in front of us at the chefs table which is probably the best seat in the house if you want dinner theater and a romantic table at the same time.  The wines were very good with long finishes and well balanced. Including the Prosecco, the Pinot Gris from Willamette  and the super Tuscan.  And saucy person that I am I asked for a tasting of each one of their desserts... I don't have a sweet tooth but I definitely ate my share and didn't complain!   Dinner was $285 tip and tax included for two people.  I gave a 25% tip because the waiter was second to none & I Loved how he didn't constantly come by fetching for compliments. Shows he has a lot of confidence in the food. My Visa card was standing to attention.... ;-)"
3,"We did a lot of shopping at the Eaton Centre Mall during a boxing day weekend and wanted to have sushi for lunch. Japango was the best rated place in the area, so we automatically wanted to get our sushi fix there. Upon arriving at the place we looked through the window and saw that this place was crowded. We really had way too many shopping bags and decided to pass on this place and maybe come back some other day.

We came back to this place on another weekend afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't a full house, maybe a couple of tables were seated with guests (which is like half of the restaurant). This place seems like a regular spot for university students. When we entered the restaurant the sushi chefs greeted us in some Japanese, Irasshaimase. But I immediately noticed later on that everyone in the back was speaking Korean. I kind of have a problem with the restaurant name calling itself \""Japango\"" when the staff themselves are not Japanese.

I looked around and thought to my self, this place looks real small.  There was barely any space to walk in-between tables. We got ourselves seated somewhere in the middle of the restaurant, across from the sushi bar. The table we were seated at was old and rickety...the table kept moving whenever our arms were leaning on either side.

We were given menus and we found it extremely difficult to read them. The font setting was small, and the restaurant was so dark when it was still bright outside. Our table had a small electric lamp thing, but it still was difficult to read mostly because of the small font. It was frustrating, especially when there are so many goddamned pages on their menu. The waiter came by to check if we needed more time on the menu, which we did due to the small font and many pages. Eventually we were ready to order. The waiter looked very pissed and impatient when he kept coming to check on us and we weren't ready to order LOL. Stuffy guy.

Anyway, onto the food. The food was very good. But so very small for the asking price! I couldn't help but feel like I only got a taster of some sort. This place is charging more for the food, they should at least have nicer tables and utensils for the guests. We were using disposable wooden chopsticks and rickety old tables. :T"
1,"Probably the best cheap eats place on Roncesvalles, where you can actually go in sit and eat with someone else for under $20. Burgers are good, not great. Fries and onion rings usually tasty.

Large high definition television in the back, and a couple smaller televisions scattered around. Looks like it could be a good place to come with a group looking to eat cheap as well. 

Service is friendly, and it's a very homey feeling. Deserving of a four star rating for being good, friendly and one of the few places to actually eat for really cheap on Roncesvalles. No gourmet burgers, and no gourmet prices. Simple."
2,"I understand it's their first few weeks but I am disappointed. We waited 1 and 1/2 until we get our buzzer. Then only  15 min and we were seated. Not Bad. We waited another half an hour before we got our meal. Again, I am ok with the wait. However , the soup was lukewarm. We asked the waiter if he can nuke it. He brought it back and said \""this time , it's hot at 110°. It was still cold. The meatloaf was also warm, not hot. I think the meal was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We ordered cheesecake after the meal and had to wait 45 min. Anyway, I will wait until the new year to try again. They have a lot of training to do. I expected more from a well established organization."
2,"Pretty much like all other O&B restaurants, Biff's is upscale with a classy vibe. Central location right across from Union Station. Dim lighting sets a romantic ambiance but it didn't feel intimate since the tables are so close together (at least the ones along the far left wall were).


We swung by after work for some dollar oysters (which starts after 5pm Tuesdays & Saturdays) and frankly, I was a little disappointed. They're tiny and some of them weren't even full oysters. I've definitely had better (i.e.: Nome Izakaya, Wilcox Gastropub to name a few).


Our server was friendly but maybe checked up on us one too many times.  


I'll probably give this place another go in the future but until then, my impression of Biff's remains as overhyped."
2,"I've stopped in here a few times when I was running from work to school and needed something to keep me going. This place is super convenient for U of T students on the go.

Although my visits here are never very long, my experiences have been pretty good. Because of its prime location, it can get really busy really fast at certain times of the day, so sometimes you can spend a while waiting in line, or there won't be any room to sit because of all the students working on their class work.

The menu is quite extensive, they have a ton of different things to choose from- coffee, tea, cocktails, and food. I've only had tea and some pastries when I was here and I have no complaints about that. The baristas seem to know what they're doing and they're good at that. Mad respect for pouring as many drinks as they do during the rush times.

My only downside is that I can never find anywhere to sit because it's so busy all the time. I would recommend it though if you're a person on the go!"
2,"Steak was very good. Not the best I had, but service was top notch. Order wagyu steak and 60 day aged. Overall a very good experience"
1,"Open late at night, Hong Shing is a popular spot for cheap Chinese grub.  Although it looks a little underwhelming on the exterior and  may be misinterpreted to be a run-down restaurant, it's actually surprisingly very clean and organized inside.  In fact, the furniture is spotless and is in good shape.  The only disorderly aspect you'll come across is the service.  Our server last weekend didn't seem to give a hoot about us and he sloppily ''pushed'' food and dinnerware onto our table. There was no spillage and our orders were accurate, so he must have been a master of service that is terrible yet, at the same time, adequate enough not to be rant-worthy. 

We were a party of four and so we got the dinner for four special (see my picture for the list of dishes).  The dishes were all large in portion-size and had heaping amounts of meat.  There's no doubt that for the cheap price you'll love this place if you're a hungry hippo. The caveat, however, is that the quality isn't exactly on point.  Our dishes were oily and were either bland or heavy on the sauce.  Therefore, if you eat here don't expect A+ food; you're going to get mass-produced cheap eats for a cheap price.  

Since Hong Shing stays open until the wee hours of the morning, I would recommend it if you're getting the munchies at night.  If you've been out drinking and need some grub in your tummy, you might as well hit this place up.  It's budget-friendly enough not to break the bank after a night out.  Just go with low expectations."
2,"I came here for Winterlicious with my cousin and had a wonderful dining experience. Giving 5 stars because not only was the food absolutely delicious, but the staff was welcoming and down-to-earth. Our server, William, deserves a high-five for being so friendly, talkative and attentive throughout the evening. As for the food, I ordered the lamb shank and off the bat, it was braised to perfection...great portions, fall-off-the-bone meat and great selections to choose from. Highly recommend dining here - kudos to the staff and talented chef :)"
1,"Yelp wins again! While I am a veteran of the Korean places along Yonge St and Christie, I had never thought of venturing to Chinatown for Korean food. And never would I set foot into a basement restaurant unless I could be certain of their food! For all you other sub-ground-food-phobic folks, don't worry. It's good here.

Big pluses: prompt service, the waitress has everything brought to your table by the time you descend their steps and open the door. GIANT tea pot (really shiny)! You'll never have to ask for a refill. A slew of side dishes, something for everyone! And, definitely not least, DERICIOUS SOON DUBU!!!! (err...Tofu, just going with the Seoraksanese pronunciation)

I found their Kamjatang not as good as I've had at other places. Its sour hint was really strong. But try the Soon Tofu here, I would say it's one of the best flavours I have ever tried. 

Atmosphere - 2.5/5
Service - 3/5
Food - 5/5
Price - 5/5"
2,"I came back to this place on Dec 27th, 2011. It's a really nice place to do work solo. I came here with my boyfriend, and we were working on something together, we almost felt bad to be talking, because we were the only group making a noise..almost awkward, we felt like we were in a library. I am not complaining, i just want to make sure people who come here will respect this, and not be surprised, and maybe it can keep it that way, so there is a coffee place for people who just want to read a book. 

I didn't see any boardgame around, either they took them away or just ever existed...anyways. Store hours is kind of short.. like other espresso bar...they close at 7pm almost every night. (although we were sitting there till 7:20pm last night, and the guy didn't really kick us out, maybe he's not in a rush either)

I had a regular brewed coffee this time, it was great! The cappuccino with single shot is a little bit light...and again not hot enough.

P.S. They don't accept credit card, only take debit or cash."
2,Amazing food ... but customer service is really really bad ... girls in the cashier has no manner
2,"The bento boxes at Red Tea Box are an original take on afternoon tea. You get a pot of tea (your choice of flavor) and an assortment of sweet and savory foods. All the food is absolutely delicious.  

Most people are seated in a quirky back room that has mismatched tables, chairs, and adornments, which gives you the feeling that you're in someone's living room. 

I've never experienced anything but good service at Red Tea Box.  

The front of the store has an assortment of gifts for tea lovers."
3,"Worst brunch ever!!!! We've gone to this restaurant for dinner on two occasions and enjoyed the meal.  What a mistake trying it for brunch - the \""French toast\"" was ONE slice of Wonderbread dipped in egg and some sour cabbage filler on the side - hardly a good pair to start with let alone leaving you starving afterward.  In a city full of artisan bakeries with amazing bread options they use chemical prepackaged white bread - worse than most cheap diners I've been to.  And, the pancake was literally ONE pancake.  With two beverages our bill was over $50 and we were left wholly unsatisfied.  TAKE A PASS ON THIS ONE."
2,"Gotta try the house bowl of noodles, it comes with a shrimp cracker. A must try anytime of the day. I can can enjoy this dish especially in the winter. Great hole in the wall family place!"
2,"I've been twice so far and have consistently experienced great service and greater food. It appears that a couple runs the restaurant - she does service and he does cooking. They are very educated about their products and the unique nordic flavours they bring to the table and their selection of eat-in and grab-and-go items is unique in a city that loves different tastes, textures and flavours. The first time I was there I ate the fried chicken. I have never had a fried chicken experience like this one. I ordered the pumpkin dumplings on the side and loved the creamed kale. The second time I had the smoked scallops in bacon cream with rapini. Yes, bacon cream. It was as great as it sounds and I was treated to an orange custard tart with cardamom sugared fruit for dessert. With so many restaurants in this city it is still so rare to find a place that serves consistently great food and that you want to come back to because you love the service you get. I am happy to recommend Karelia and look forward to my Valentine's Day dinner there. Go try it! You won't regret it!"
1,"Brunch with friends after far too long and this was the perfect spot. Decor is reminiscent of an old diner with a counter with stools and a few tables. Service was very courteous, friendly and quick. Although they \""forgot\"" my order, they quickly rectified it!
I ordered a cafe con leche and it was smooth, creamy and delicious.
My main was the Guava BBQ beef short rib plate. Absolutely delicious. Tender beef with a great variety of sides. Lightly pickled red cabbage, rice and beans and tostones. Comes topped with crispy onions. If you like heat the hot sauce is made in house and definately worth trying. All for just over $20.00. 
So much food that I had leftovers which I enjoyed later in the day!"
2,"I would give L'Espresso Bar Mercurio a 3.5/5. We came on a day where they said their kitchen was closed due to the holidays. It seemed like a lot of the customers were disappointed so I probably didn't get the full Bar Mercurio experience. 

My friend and I seated ourselves. It was pretty busy for a weekday morning. Because their kitchen was closed we decided to grab a sandwich. I had asked the lady to remove the bacon before grilling my sandwich and she said she couldn't because she didn't have gloves. She also couldn't help us cut our sandwiches. I remember Starbucks couldn't cut sandwiches due to their food license but Bar Mercurio has a full kitchen. I found it hard to believe she couldn't do it for me. 

Other than that, the sandwiches were good. I had the Chicken BLT panini which had a kick due to the chipotle mayo. The caprese panini was also good according to my friend. They brush olive oil and some spices on the flat bread so I enjoyed the sandwich. 

I would give this place another shot when their kitchen is open but the prices are a bit up there. I feel you can find better for lower prices."
2,"The truth is that I'm torn.  Politically, I really want to dislike Wild Wing, and it's because it's a franchise chain, and because franchise chains tend to threaten local pubs and bistros and so ruin a local area's unique vibe and character.  There are enough stripmalls and carboncopy eateries in the world already, as far as I'm concerned.

The Wild Wing Corporation has seemingly sprung up all over downtown Toronto in the last year, clearly trying to homogenize and muscle in on the growing Buffalo wing craze.  This particular location is very probably trying to draw customers away from my own personal and beloved haunt, Loons, which is about a block away at the Roncesvalles/Howard Park intersection.  I'm worried.

Thankfully, Loons still has it down when it comes to solid, stick-to-your-ribs hot meals apart from the standard pubfare, and their wings are seriously good, all considered.  But I'm afraid that I do have to admit that, in some ways, Wild Wings is a like an upstart, young Sugar Ray Leonard here, giving the well-established challengers some bopping and swerving moves in the ring.

To start with, WW boasts some 91 flavours to choose from, and about half of those are actually not some variant of hot and spicy.  This is good news for those of a mellower palate who simply want to enjoy some pleasant sauces on their poultry limbs instead of feeling embers from Hades sliding down their throats.  

These flavours include a variety of assorted clerverly-named blends and fusions of any or all of these:  BBQ, jerk, pineapple, maple, curry, honey garlic, Thai, mango, garlic, Cajun, chipotle, lemon, dill, kethcup, buttermilk, parmesan, ranch, caesar, mustard, hickory, black pepper, teriyaki, and yes, chocolate.

But I'm a fire man, and the hottest to be offered here include \""She's a Hottie\"" (triple suicide blend), \""Cadillac Ranch\"" (caesar/ranch/suicide), \""Home On The Ranch\"" (ranch/suicide), \""Bubba's Backfire\"" (BBQ/suicide), \""Catch Me If You Can\"" (maple/suicide), my personal fave \""Dusty Muckaroo\"" (honey garlic/suicide), and their two super inferno options, \""Sweatin Bullets\"" (a suicide/smokey BBQ fusion) and Ring Of Fire (blend of various suicides).  Whoah.

Wings are offered in counts of 9, 18, 28, 36, 50, and 100 pieces, all with option of regular or boneless, breaded or not.  It's a tad expensive here, but if you're smart you might show up on one of their specials nights: Tuesday (14 wings for $10), Wednesday (double wings and a pitcher for $30), or Thursday (pint and pound for $13).

Wings are served with ranch or bleu cheese options, but in cups that are half-full at best.  The metal busket (like those found at Duff's) is useful, as are the particularly firm and large wetnaps available.

Sometimes the vibe is cool and distant, but you can always relax on the extensive side patio with its young trees and view of passing streetcars.  

The brats eat free on Sundays.  The meatheads enjoy UFC on the big screens here.  If you're driving and it;s after normal business hours, take a chance and park in the Master Mechanic's lot across the street.

The biggest drawback is the price and the general lack of unique character (unless fresh-from-the-box psuedo-Western is your thing), but I have to say than tham thar wings is purdy damned okelydokely."
2,"We reserved this restaurant for a birthday party around end of November. We were around 20 people so we needed to book multiple tables. We were given the table at the far end of the restaurant and two more tables which were in the same area. 

The service was EXCELLENT. It was a party and we were all over the place. Our server however, (and honestly the rest of the staff) were quite cooperative and understanding. This is important because we were on their way from kitchen to the dining area and also one of their cash stations. For 25$, they took care of the cake the best way I could think of. 

We wanted to order tea for each person at the time the cake was served and this meant we wanted to get 25 of their cups! They just accomodated everything to the best of it. The gentleman which I believe was the manager was continuously making sure that everything is in place with us and with other guests. 

I don't think I need to talk about the food and the quality. We ordered a mixture of breakfast and lunch and they were all at their perfect level. Their famous egg's benedict is phenomenal. All my guests and my sister (whose BDay we were celebrating) were quite happy with everything. Food, drink, environment, staff, location. quality, accommodation, ...

This review could probably be a way I say thanks for the great experience we had at the lovely Oxley's"
2,We came back on the managers invitation and have to say that the meal and dining experience was fantastic. The staff were attentive and funny. They listened to our dietary needs and produced standout meals. The cocktails are STARS here. Wow! Perfect balance for each of our tastes. The calamari was well prepared with a nice spicy salsa side and aioli. I had the arugula salad with toasted almonds and pears. Our chef special included salmon with grilled veggies (including my fave red and yellow peppers). My husband had the tiramisu and I drooled over it (will come back after my cleanse to try it for sure).
2,"Excellent sandwiches and friendly service. Authentic Italian prepared spreads and toppings, wonderfully marinated. Almost everything here is prepared by the owner. 

Favourites are pulled chicken, roast beef and eggplant or veal parm."
1,"I haven't written a review in ages, and this place is totally worth of me coming back from my hibernation. It's a solid five star (or six, if there were that many) tea/coffee (but heavily tea) house, specialized on tea lattes - DELICIOUS tea lattes, which they'll brew with any kind of milk you like, no fuss, and serve you with a beautiful smile, like you are their best and only customer, the Queen ( or King) of Tea World, as you're offering them a million dollar per cup (and you're not - it's the same as Starbucks). I felt so special there I want to come back every single day. 

This place is my tiny little paradise in Parkdale. Please exist forever, as I love you."
2,"The food is quite good - fresh, savoury, rich - but the service after two visits is so bad I'll never go back. Well meaning servers, but the design of the seating, plus the apparent inexperience of the management, means you can expect to wait for an hour for a table. The guy who looks like he might own the place makes coffee verrrrrry slowly while you scan the restaurant hopelessly for some better workflow. They'll seat a group of two in a table for four then you and your party of four wait and watch for 45 minutes for their food to come. Awkward. Once you get your table you're told that 1/3 of the menu is not available. And it's stressful in there; asking for water becomes an ordeal.  One server for 7-8 tables. No food is worth this kind of service."
1,"The burritos are huge and awesome. I always order the small chicken because it's massive, tasty and filling. I have also tried their chips,beef burrito and chicken nuggets... All great! Chicken nugget combo is $4.99 and comes with a lot of food.  Their prices are reasonable. Their service is fast and friendly.  It's a fast food restaurant, so don't expect much from their decor. They only have about 6-8 tables. Doesn't matter though... The food is really really good!"
3,"A little pricy fusion Japanese place, but very unique menu items. Definitely must try the Black Diamond, which is an unagi (eel) maki made with black rice, topped with foie gras and caviar. Rich (not me, but in flavor and texture), juicy, creamy. Something I order every time I go. Their chirashi is also what I love, very fresh, sashimi salmon, uni, and salmon roe on bed of sushi rice. The tea rice is also another interesting one that I have not seen elsewhere in Canada. It is a comparatively cheaper option on the menu, but very tasty if you are looking for something light to pair with other heavy items, like the Black Diamond. Tofu cheesecake is a must-try as well. A little too small of a portion and it is never enough. Their VIP cards are super unique, made of metal, engraved with their logo and info, along with a serial number. Only thing I would really criticize is the parking, which takes forever to find a spot."
2,"I'm torn. More like a 4.5 - it was delicious.

Here's the caveat - their menu says that the first two options are a bun or wrap. I assumed that meant the others are bun-based (after all, \""sammich!\"") but alas it came in a wrap.

So - I had the Cluckin' Good. Was it really yummy? Yup. But as a warp, it just was not as appetizing (and again, the name is sammich).

I was really looking forward to trying to cheese steak option, but as a wrap? Boo."
1,"Great place to hang out with friends/co-workers.  Came here on a Thursday for lunch with some girl friends hoping to get the 100 oysters for $100 but it was only offered on Thursday evening.  We still got the dozen oysters for $18 which is still a pretty good deal.  It was super fresh!  Everything we had was delicious which included the grilled sea bream, mussels, fish & chips, crispy calamari, and chicken liver pate.  We pretty much tried everything on their lunch menu.

Don't forget to check in to get your 10% discount.  Note that it doesn't include drinks and the dozen oysters special but it's still great to get a discount."
2,"Such a cute little joint tucked away at Princess and The Esplanade! The cashier was amazing at recommending the best choices on their menu. It is a small menu but nonetheless very exciting. They offer the traditional dark meat fried or a more healthy option, the chicken breast fried. Either way, both were served on a Waffle with a side and a drink. The options for sides were Fries, Wedges and Coleslaw. We opted for the wedges but now thinking back, I want to try to the coleslaw next time! The chicken breast option was given an additional option to make it into a sandwich. I did prefer an open face waffle then the sandwich. 

This was definitely a must try as the fried chicken was tender and flaky, way better then KFC. The sauces were amazing as well, I definitely recommend the Chipotle Aioli and the Cluck sauce which has a sweet note. This Chicken and Waffles is definitely better than The Stockyards!"
2,"Located in Liberty Village, this local sports bar is a busy place with an open patio and lots of sitting area. 
They have an outdoor game which makes it entertaining to watch others play or if your familiar with it, you join in the fun (sorry have no clue what this game is called)

Food was served in portions similar to a high end restaurant. So not your average sports bar. 

It was however, very delicious. I had the burger with sweet potato fries. My sister had the burger with a salad and my mom had a chicken salad ( quite small not filling)

Service was at a good pace and the staff were friendly. 

Music was definitely retro 80's, not complaining brought back memories and my mom enjoyed it. 

This is a great place for an outing with a group of friends. 

The reason I gave it a 4 star was because the table wobbled so much, that it didn't make a difference when the waitress put a stack of coasters under it. Therefore we had to be very careful with our drinks. 

On that note I will still eat here again and make sure to do a wobble table test before sitting down  ;)

Happy eatings :)"
2,"Good option for vegetarians and vegans with an extensive menu. I ordered dinner and noted that they have moderately priced lunch specials but it appears that only one option per day is veggie/vegan so keep that in mind if you're looking for a midday deal.

My favorite dish was the Bangkok Market Tofu'n'Taro appetizer, which as the name indicates features generous portions of fried tofu and taro. I had never tasted fried taro, and it definitely outshone the ho hum tofu as it was perfectly crisp and subtly sweet, pairing well with the light dipping sauce.

I also tried the Pad Chaa, but was not pleased with the bland sauce or the texture of the fake BBQ meat. The accompanying rice tasted off to me, so unfortunately I ended up not eating it.
There are so many menu choices, there must be better options for a main course."
2,"Subsequently spoke with another manager who professionally and kindly resolved the issue. We took her invitation to return....

...and we did. 

A+. The level of professional service from Javed and Nazmul was subtle and sublime. All courses, especially the corn and tomato gazpacho, duck confit and cod three ways were perfectly prepared.

Needless to say, the 360 views on a crystal clear day were spectacular!"
2,Amazing craft beer selection and the food is absolutely excellent. The bread and cheese plates are highly recommended as well as the green tomatoes.
3,"This is a raucous, rowdy, lively restaurant that's fun to be at with friends (but probably not a good first date place).

The service is pretty good, the servers are constantly shouting things to hype up the atmosphere, and I wonder how they don't lose their voices! The seating is kind of cramped but it's part of the charm, I suppose.

As for the food...the presentation certainly is beautiful. Every dish is very pretty and if you sit at the bar, you can see a lot of them put together. But it's on the pricey side and to be perfectly honest, (and at the risk of losing all my Yelp cred) I prefer Yang's Kitchen up at Markham - when it comes to similar dishes, anyway.

The fried tofu was dipped in a gooey kind of batter - the parts that didn't touch liquid were nice and crisp but the parts that came into contact with liquid (which was essentially the whole bottom half, because it's served sitting in sauce) was really slimy and gooey. It was really weird.

I prefer the grilled eggplant at Yang's over the miso eggplant here because it's fully cooked, and the grilled flavour is more fragrant. The miso eggplant at Kinka tastes really basic, like something I could easily prepare together by mixing some miso, sake, and mirin together and throwing it in a pan with some eggplant.

The baked oysters were good, but nothing spectacular. Ditto the grilled cod - I feel that the grilled cod at Yang's tastes better because there's less skin, so there's more caramelized meat surface, and because the version at Kinka seems to have a lot more bones. 

The mentaiko udon was nice but kind of overcooked and the flavour really wasn't that special.

This is a decent place - you probably won't have a bad meal here - but to me, it just doesn't live up to the hype and I feel that I can get better tasting food at a significantly lower prices elsewhere."
2,Waited for a long time to try this place! I had a regular with the pepper pares an and all I can say is Yummy! Fries were fresh not oily. My partner had the poutinery and was tasty good! I know I'm coming back!
2,"So the unfortunate reality about Toronto is that it's actually really hard to find great Dosas! That being said, Madras Masala is pretty good; you'll be just fine coming here as there really isn't a better option downtown that I know of. 

My 3 stars really should be a 3.5 but that's not possible with Yelp and 4 stars just doesn't seem right.

If you haven't experienced South Indian cuisine, then you will have no problem enjoying this place.

Most importantly, I can confidently say that I have been here multiple times and will return multiple times again in the future.

Enjoy. :)"
2,Happened upon this place and thought why not after reading the menu.. interesting.  Well no disappointments here.. the food was awesome fun and the beers.. different which made this place a certain come back for sure.  Love it
2,"We were with a group from the Yankee Air Museum that had made dinner reservations for the 360 Restaurant with their three course prix fixe menu, or fixed price menu.  For a set price we got to select one choice from the items listed under Appetizer, Main Course, and Dessert.

We have previously eaten at other Tower restaurants and, for the most part, the food is just OK; the real attraction is the view while you eat.  That was my expectation for our dinner at CN Tower as we studied the choices.  My wife and I both chose the Albacore Tuna Crudo for an appetizer.  For the Main Course my wife chose a Taste of Fogo Island and I decided to try the 45-Day Aged Alberta Prime Rib.  Finally, for dessert, wife went for the Chocolate Tower; I wanted Banana and Toffee Verrine, but after I mentioned my peanut allergy, the waiter switched it to Mango Sherbet and Raspberry Sherbet.

After our drinks (Diet Coke) and a Bread Basket were delivered, our other choices came at a great pace for us to eat and enjoy conversation.  To our pleasant surprise, the food was very good; even my Prime Rib was done perfectly as I requested.  Throughout the meal, the service was excellent.  We were impressed with everything except for the Initial 20-30 minute delay to be seated.  Even the weather cooperated and visibility was great!"
3,"This place is wildly overpriced. $10 for a regular sized shawarma sandwich is one of the most expensive shawarma prices in Toronto.

The beef shawarma tasted like it was covered in lime juice. There was no other flavour because the lime was too powerful. It was so sour and awful that I will never be trying this place again."
3,"Brunch in Yorkville sounds so fancy.  And Sassafraz tried to provide that reputation.  The room was impressive with sky light, living wall and \""waterfalls\"".  I liked the feeling that I was outside but still within the cooling interior. 
I ordered the omelet.  It was ok but not wowed at $21.  My friend ordered eggs Benedict.   Gordon Ramsay definitely would not be impressed with the overcooked eggs.
Service was random.  The bread was forgotten until after our meals were served.  And it took a long time before our mimosa got to us.  
Cute place, but with room for improvement."
2,"Great tacos.  A great neighborhood spot. Lots of charm. Expect a wait. 

What to order: 
Chicken tacos- 
Don't normally love chicken tacos, as they are often bland, but these were juicy and perfect! 

Tuna ceviche- tasty dish. It has an intense lime / citrus flavor and could have used some chips to accompany it. 

What to skip :
Fava beans and chorizo- flavors didn't really mesh with the rest of the menu"
2,"I went here with my friends and everything we ordered tasted amazing. There was nothing on the menu we did not like. The atmosphere was very fun too! The people who work there are great. The only downside is that it gets really busy and there is always a line up. Also, the atmosphere is loud, so I wouldn't go here for an intimate dinner."
1,"Now that I've visited IAH a number of times since my last review I can safely say that it is, hands down, my go to bar in the Junction.  Since opening, IAH has expanded their craft brew selection to include an ever changing line-up of  porters, stouts, and wheats along with their IPA's.  As I'm not a fan of IPA's in general I stick with the other options and have yet to be disappointed. I am particularly fond of their Breakfast Porter, Wit'ner Toque, Quiet Time, Icebreaker and Red Tape Stout, i.e., any dark, strong beer. One of the nice things is that all of their beers regardless of the alcohol content are roughly the same price (~$5.50).

The servers are all pleasant and many have been there since the start, which adds to the venue's community feel. They do not take reservations on Friday or Saturday  nights after 5pm so I would suggest getting there before 6pm if you don't want to wait for a table.

The menu (which also changes frequently) is much better than your average pub. Their modern take on standard dishes (e.g., Scotch Bonnet flavoured Chicken Wings, Shrimp Taco, Aubergine Burger, ect.) all at a reasonable price (~$15.50) have never left me wanting.  I especially like the Mac & Cheese w/ pulled pork, Pizza w/ sausage and goat cheese and Pork Rib Burger.

The lighting still bugs me, but the service, great food and most importantly phenomenal selection of unique craft beers at a reasonable price far outweigh this.

I would recommend IAH to anyone who likes, or wants to sample a wide range of craft beers."
1,"Decent Sushi restaurant in an area that desperately needed one. No more walking north of Sheppard to grab my sushi fix. The prices are reasonable and the portions are decent. 

I ordered the daily special (Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box) and a Salmon Don. The chicken teriyaki is not your typical bentobox. I liked that it included a shrimp tempura and a couple crab roll pieces on the side. The only cons would be the bland color presentation (see pic) and the chicken teriyaki to rice ratio was a little off. The teriyaki was breaded which I thought I would not enjoy but the breading was crispy and was a nice change.  For the price I think it was a great deal and a good overall portion. 

The salmon don was fresh and tasty with no cons. The portion was great. Lots of nicely sliced salmon pieces over a bed of rice with radish, seaweed,ginger and wasabi.  

The owner is very friendly and the dining area is clean. I will be getting a few roll dishes to see how they are on my next visit."
2,"I've been here about five times and four of those times I've waited over a half hour for rice to be made or there is no fish. The food is so yummy which is why I keep coming back but pull it together. You've been open a few months now, haven't you learned to order the right amount of fish or when to turn on a rice machine? Why should anyone wait over a half hour for something that isn't even being"
2,"The Church street Ginger franchise is the newest that I know of in the city and by far one of the swankier ones, even if it still maintains that cefeteria vibe of the others. My heart will always be with the Ginger next to the Brass Rail on Yonge, but this one is a nice addition to the Church Street Village and just like the others, a great spot to grab a quick bite on the go."
2,"We've coming to this restaurant( on/off) for years and this time it was for a birthday celebration. It felt like a complete disaster and an embarrassment this time and it has left us feeling like we never want to come back again (there are so much other places to try!!)

We came on a busy Saturday evening with reservations- no waiting, however there's 1 waitress for the main floor and 1 waiter on the first floor. FYI- it is not a kid friendly (food-wise) or elder friendly (a full flight of stairs to access toilet).

It took our waitress almost 10 mins to come get our order and that too she rushed while we were ordering our drinks as she went to sit other people in middle of taking our order. We asked for spoons and she was sooo reluctant to give us any and repeatedly said that we don't have spoons...yes, I'm aware of your culture and trust me we know that better coming from Indian background, however we don't impose that in a restaurant!!!! And not to mention we have been there before several times and got spoons every time we asked for. 

By this time, we were already not impressed by the whole experience. 20-25 mins into us being there, my husband wanted place an order for their \""special coffee\"" however he got brushed off and was told that the kitchen is too busy and it will take them an hour. He was discouraged by the waitress and waiter right away...well then do a better job in waitressing and perhaps let people know earlier on or put in your menu that it would be an hour (btw- menu says 30 mins!!).

Food is nothing extraordinary and there are better Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto."
2,"Every time I go to this place I get out of there happy.  Fresh ingredients, delicious bowls and friendly service!  Totally recommend it.  Sometimes there's a long line but if you're not in a rush it's worth the wait."
2,"Amazing good food! Nothing that hasn't been said or experienced before. It gets very busy so I suggest focus on scoping out a table before lining up to order anything if you have company. 
We had the burrito, fajitas, corn and guacamole with chips. We had a hard time finishing it all up between 3 people so portions are clearly very generous! The only minor compliant would be chips contain a lot more if broken pieces than whole ones. But that's not enough to deny them the 5 star rating they truly deserve! I'll definitely be back!"
2,"tldr: Coffee shop/bakery you'd find in the hipster districts of Tokyo. High quality ingredients, people, and final products.

Little Pebbles is a Japanese-run cafe. The offers are made from a eclectic array of Japanese ingredients including matcha, black seasame, and kinako. There are always special items on the menu. If you can get the daifuku mochi (with real fruit inside with azuki bean), get it. The kinako latte with almond milk is amazingly different. Must-go."
2,"Great variety of Vietnamese dishes. Might not be the most authentic one, but it tastes good and price right. Portion is great enough, if you order a large pho, it is good enough to be shared by 2 people. It is always busy, even after 10pm. I would recommend anyone who wants Vietnamese food to go there. I don't think you will be disappointed, other than saying it's hard to find a parking spot at that plaza. Enjoy guys!"
1,"For the price range-this place is good. Cheapest AYCE in downtown Toronto by far. If you're looking for a cheap, fast, filling meal this is the place to go. For a special exquisite meal, definitely not.

The Good
-Price, price, price
-Fast service
-Fresh fish 

The Bad
-The sashimi pieces were very small
-The rice was warm and kept falling apart for the sushi, annoying but not uneatable
-The atmosphere is similar to that of a foodcourt with the beige tables and chairs
-The yakitori was uneatable due to the slathering of sauce, definitely don't recommend this dish

Overall, if you're looking to save a buck, give this place a try."
1,"I'm glad I tried this restaurant out, I was wary since there was no website, no online menu, no reviews or photos. Like most South American restaurants I've been to, it looks like a small family-run restaurant. The deco is simple and the atmosphere is very cozy. The table set-up seats no guests no more than 4 to a table, when our party of 5 came in, there was no service staff out front so we had to move tables around ourselves and seat ourselves.

Like most small Spanish restaurants, the staff didn't speak much English, so it's hard to ask questions about the menu. However, despite the language barrier the waitress was very helpful, friendly and tried her best to answer our questions.

I ordered the Paiza (beef steak, chorizo, chicharron, beans, fried plantains and a fried egg), while my brothers ordered the chicken breast and the chipotle chicken, and my parents one of the soups. The food came out fairly quickly (we passed time trying to understand the Spanish soap opera on the tv). The beef was super flavourful, it was my favourite thing on my plate. The chicharron was nice and crispy. The chorizo was good too. The rice wasn't seasoned or flavourful enough compared to what I'm used to. I got to try my brother's chipotle chicken, he liked it but I thought it tasted weird and nothing like chipotle. Along with our food, they gave us small plates of Salvadoran corn tortillas (I think called papusas?) And a bowl of bean puree. The tortillas were delicious, we could tell they were made in-house like everything else. The bean puree was ok, I'm more a fan of whole beans and honestly, a small bowl to share between 4 people (I had my own) was not enough. Also, if you're a fan of spiciness, definitely ask/try their hot sauce, it's a good heat level and looked/tasted homemade too. Overall, I love the homey feel and taste of everything, it feels like I went to eat at someone's house as opposed to a restaurant. The price is also pretty good, we spent around $80 when we're used to spending over $100 when we eat out. I definitely will be going back to try their other stuff and get more of their tortillas and hot sauce."
1,"3-1/2 stars.

Went here for lunch on a Saturday and the place was 1/4 full which was fine by me as I was looking for a good quick meal.

I wanted to have some Pho, but I was a little disappointed with the lack of selection of Pho in the menu. Other Pho restaurants had countless combinations of meats you could choose for their Pho, but Anh Dao just had maybe 3 or 4 (I was hoping for rare beef, tripe and tendon).

Don't be mislead by the prices, the portions are large. I ordered the Bun with spring roll and BBQ beef ($5.95) and a fresh spring roll with pork and shrimp ($3.95). The spring roll was twice as long as what was pictured in the menu and the Bun was of your typical sized bun at other restaurants.

The spring roll was good and the sauce tasted like a thickened soy sauce sweetened with honey, similar to teriyaki sauce but lighter.
The bun was also good, but not spectacular, but at less than $6 it was a great deal. I dumped all of the side sauce and added a little soy sauce and chili sauce which made the bun much more tasty and not as dry.
The bowl was a good mix of fresh greens with the meat and vermicelli.
Word of caution, do not eat the fried spring rolls first! I scorched the roof of my mouth by doing so.

The complimentary tea was tasty but served scorching hot in a large tea pot.

The service was fast and the waitor always acknowledged you with a smile.

One really minor gripe I had was that you helped yourself chopsticks and spoons that were bunched up at each table, some were sticking with the spoon or tip side up. For germophobes like me that could be a bit of a turn off."
2,"Had the chicken souvlaki on a bun+onion rings and it was pretty good, definitely a spot I'd come back to when I want some quick greek food"
2,"This meal totally hit the spot. Honestly I think the soft, buttery roll bread was the best part of the meal. I got a Oreo milkshake too and it was really satisfying all together. The Mac and cheese on the Hot Dog could have used some more flavor but the animal style fries made up for it."
1,"Comfort food done right and at its best. I came here with a group of six on friday feb 21st for dinner. Our server Michelle was very pleasant and willing to help us out with choices and drinks were yummy right off the bat. 
It was my wifey's bday and we were heading out after to drink so we wanted to do something light. We opted for the mac n cheese as we both LOVE it. They were so nice as to seperate it into two nice sized bowls with a piece of garlic loaf each. WOW!!!!!!!! I cannot overstate how freaking awesome the food was! Creamy with just the right hint of different cheeses, The pasta was cooked el dente and was spiral perfection. We also had the deviled eggs which were amazing. Everyone loved their choice. As we are a sharing group of friends I also had the tatter tots which left me speechless on how the right amount of crunch was combined with potatoey goodness. Sheppards pie was also super fab. We will be coming here again and again as the service was stellar, the food was out of this world great and the prices cannot be beat. with 8 drinks, mac n cheese and deviled eggs the bill was only $55!!! They are getting a renovation and I can't wait to make a reservation for a large party at this amazing hidden gem in K-town."
2,"Food: 3 stars 
Strolling along Eglinton when I stopped to check out a large poster of their menu on the outside. A friendly elderly lady came out to greet me and invited me inside to check out their whole menu. The restaurant seems to be run by an elderly couple. They were really trying to sell me on...basically everything, but I only wanted a Greek salad. It was $7.99 so about $9 with tax. Portion size was ok. Box was big but it wasn't very filled. Salad was pretty fresh. A little too much dressing but good overall. 

Ambiance: 2.5 stars
Very simple interior. A little rundown. I wouldn't really want to sit down and eat there. More of a grab and go sort of place. 

Service: 3 stars
I don't really like to be sold on anything. I prefer to just look and I'll ask if I want clarification on a dish but they were very friendly and welcoming."
1,"Totally hidden, but does Korean food great!

The food court was pretty much empty when me and my friends went to eat, but that's a given for about 4 pm on a Tuesday. Between us we ordered the chicken bibimbap, beef bibimbap and the bulgogi plate with purple rice, with a side of vegetable dumplings and spicy chicken.

For the price, it's quite worth it, but the location is kind of unfortunate. The food was great and pretty well sized for about $8 a piece. Food came very promptly and we were given the bottle of gochujang (hot pepper sauce) on the side by the kind woman who was working the counter when we arrived. Great place to check out if you're just looking for quick good K-food near the Eaton centre downtown!"
1,"After expecting to meet my friend at a regular greasy spoon falafel joint my experience at the Yonge & Dundas Paramount was excellent.

The ambiance was a perfect mix of Toronto and the Middle East. Exposed brick and modern fixtures were perfectly juxtaposed with the huge trays of baklava and kaak kinafe on traditional brass stands. 

We shared a mediocre fattoush salad and each got a Manakeesh (pizza) which were $3.99 each and 10\"". The accawi cheese with zaatar (fried thyme and sesame) Manakeesh was really delicious. Spinach with cheese was so-so and had an odd sour note. 

 What really made the meal knock my socks off was the HOT SAUSE! YUM! They make it in their own facility (where their Mississauga location is). It has onions and tomato, black and red pepper. ASK for this. This sauce makes everything taste outstanding- especially the complimentary piping hot pita.

With a tiny taste of Baklava \""on the house\"" I am already looking forward to my next visit - on the weekend so I can try the weekends-only appetizers, at an off time to avoid the inevitable crowds."
2,"It's a great work lunch spot as many have already confirmed. Having said that, I always make a reservation so I don't need to wait for a table. It's recommended especially if it's a bigger group. They also have a takeout section so if you're in a rush that's the alternative."
2,"THE BEST TACOS

This place is always busy with a line out the door with very little seating inside and a few standing spots. Get ready to eat with very little elbow room and no place to put your jacket or bag. While others hover around for your standing area with sauce all over your hands. But its worth it. It also has a very \""toronto\"" vibe located in the awesome area of kensington market, it feels local, with an eclectic mix of hipsters, kids in strollers and yuppies coming here. 

The Gobernador has so much stuff - shrimps, tuna and cheese - whats not to like. And double corn tortillas are the only way to go if you're gonna do tacos right. Their ceviche is tangy and the portion is large, a small mountain of mixed seafood with lots of lime juice and onions with a tostada hat. They also have a hot sauce / salsa bar - DELISH! 

Wash it all down with their daily aqua fresca (the day I was there it was cantaloupe) sweet and refreshing with the meal."
2,"Wow!! First time here, we ordered the Arugula salad and the Margarita pizza... AMAZING! 
Service, amazing! Environment so nice and music was great too. I'm coming back!"
1,"I came back in June and I see that they've updated their menu, noodle refills are now $2 as opposed to free. Regardless the updated menu is easier to read and the price for the soup hasn't changed!"
2,"I don't think a long review is warranted, simply because it's not safe for me to eat here (peanut allergy). 

Suffice it to say that the waiter straight up told me when I was about to order that it wasn't safe to eat. Good to know, but would be better if it was more well known (or at the very least, better advertised).

EDIT: To clarify, I asked before ordering what I could and could not eat, given that I had a peanut (but not a nut) allergy. The waiter then informed me that nothing was safe, and that's where I take issue: they could easily just clean the cooking material better, but not taking the time or effort to do so warrants my one-star review.

I did my due diligence to verify my situation, so please do not send me further hateful comments regarding my allergy. I cannot choose what I am deathly allergic to - I just have to deal with this throughout my life."
2,"Completely average. Staff is curt. Food is ok. There are actually a lot of tables in the back area, so at least you probably won't have to wait."
2,"I'm not a Manic Maniac. There are so many places for good coffee these days that one isn't too much better than the next (in my opinion). So if that's the case, why choose Manic? well if you like waiting for seats, I guess it's alright. If you sometimes like a time-limit on your spot, that's also a good reason to go. If you like snobby baristas that have little patience, you should check it out.

Aside from those reasons, you can try a cup of coffee from their clover machine which makes a good cup of joe but again, not THAT much better than a standard latte. 

They do justice to coffee but the quality of coffee is burdened from the poorer quality of service and experience that customers look for in a coffee place."
2,I was initially attracted to the decor. Surprising so many places on Younge street are run down. Menu is nice -- not too big. Chef will not do any changes to the menu. A bit pretentious. I'm from LA and the nicer the restaurant the more willing the chef is to make changes for wealthy patrons. Even celebrity chefs come out to great patrons and make anything you want. Here it seems to be the opposite as places like Terroni won't make changes or customize. Terroni is much bigger so I understand they have too many customers to do changes but the small places like this the chef should make you happy and not think his way is the only way to eat. Anyway the food was good. We had a lovely lunch. Service was a bit novice. These are not pros. I liked it enough to return.
1,"Dear, Cora Pizza...

I love you and all the yummy goodness you have provided my stomach over the past two years. As a proud 'card' holder, I will continue to offer you my undying loyalty $4 at a time. Your service, food, pricing, and hours of operation are amazing. Thank you for satisfying my daily pizza cravings. 

PS: I recommend trying every slice they have to offer."
3,I get the concept but unfortunately this didn't work for me. Way too messy especially when your wearing light clothing. I felt it was pricey for the amount of seafood you get. The amount of shrimp in my bag did not seem like a pound to me. And I don't mind shelling them myself but having to remove the heads and legs is a bit much.
2,We went here for dessert last night with our group of friends. I had the mango supreme and it gave me a bad stomach ache. My SO had a piece of my mango supreme and also got sick. Our friends ordered something that had no mango contents and were fine. Beware.
2,"My vacation to Toronto provided some amazing culinary treats over the week we we there.... Odd Seoul was one of the very best, amongst many greats! Maybe I'm a bit biased, as the Lower Ossington neighborhood reminds me very much of my own neighborhood back home, but the vibe is just right while the look and feel of the bar are warm and inviting, while also conveying the proper confidence that you just know you're going to get a really good cocktail there. We tried several of the craft cocktails - including the Bulleit Smash and the Odd Fashioned - and nothing disappointed! Same for the menu, which is limited in quantity, not in quality! I swear, they could double the number of items and I'd still have eaten them all! Particularly, their steam buns, Bulgogi Cheesesteak and Tempura Prawns were incredible. As a bartender, I always like to get to know the staff, management and owners of the places I visit, particularly when I really like the place, and I did have the fortune of meeting Leeto, who owns Odd Seoul with his brother Leemo, and I must say I wish nothing but many years of success for you both (if you're reading this) and we will be back!!!"
2,"A great idea. WIth great potential. As of this week, ultimately disappointing. 

With a beer selection as fantastic as they have here, why can you not create your own flight? I cannot believe this. I was insulted to see that, in a sampler, I had to drink the beers that THEY choose. As a beer lover, I wanted to drink samples of the beers that I love, not the beers that they chose for me.

It's the \""walled garden\"" of beer tasting.

My wife, wanting the awesome Oranje Weiss, was forced to drink a sampler with beer she didn't like. 

Anyway, I was surprised by the beer selection here. They have more beer offered here than in Amsterdam's actual brewery! Fantastic

We went there after opening day so that we could avoid all of the service disasters, but our nice waitress still seemed pretty aloof. 

Finally, our ghost chili wings were not spicy. 

I'll come back in a year and hope that the restaurant is run as well as the brewery. 

The Fracture IIPA is really good."
2,"Popeyes chicken is always good, their chicken is always hot and cripsy. I usually order the 10 peices with 2 sides, mash potatoes and Cajon rice. However, recently they discontinued the cajun rice which is really disappointing. I substituted it with the beans and rice but it's not the same. They need to bring back the cajun rice! But overall, great meal for family time."
2,"The pizza is average. The star rating is for the owner, who is consistently yelling at her staff for the most mediocre things. Missing a few cents, something she didn't agree with. Constantly talking down to them. Had to actually tell her one day she was being inappropriate and that the restaurant could hear her. Awful. If I were a franchise owner I would be revoking her access to the Pizza Pizza name."
2,"Over hyped. This place is pretty and there are many places to eat and things to do, but it's a little out of the way and nothing really stands out. Whenever a friend comes from out of town they generally check out the spot. They take the picture with the locks. They go to eat some desserts and they check out some art. 

Then they come back feeling underwhelmed. The place is like a good movie that got stellar reviews, so you're kind of left wondering what all the fuss was about. 

With that said, the place is good. There's some good coffee and sake. The art galleries are better than expected and the sushi is good too. The only reason it gets 3 instead of 4 is that it COULD be so much more. It should be. It must be. I'm assuming as Toronto moves out east the area will get better and better, but for now it's a good 3/5."
2,"Delicious food horrible service. They just lost a valued reoccurring customer.
No food is worth 2 MEN not caring what you want from their establishment and then hanging up. Hey young lady who works here, on the other hand, is a sweetheart I wish she had pick up the phone in their stead. Sad day. Not happy."
1,"You have a line of people ahead of you but if you don't mind waiting, it's worth the meal. You can't beat their noodle soup on a cold day. I got their Fudao original for $8.49 which their price is a very decent and the food is generous."
2,"Let me start off by saying that I've lived in LA for the past 13 years and so I have a very high standard when it comes to Korean food as I believe it's the best in the world (including Korean food in Korea).

I had low expectations going into this place and I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the service was great. The manager (or owner) went around and greeted the customers and even had a friendly chat with them and would also help serve the food so for that I give them props, but as far as how the food tasted, to me, it's more for non-Koreans (aka white people). I'm not racist (ok maybe a little) but I've noticed the great Korean food spots have little or no non-Koreans and the restaurant looks like shit on the outside and in. The restaurants that have a nicer interior and better service is meant to cater to a different crowd.

So... if you're white, you'll like this place, otherwise, I'd avoid eating Korean food in general in Toronto as I've yet to find one that I enjoyed.

Also, parking is absolutely horrible. You will have to pay for parking. Either sell your soul to the devil and find one on the street or pay a few extra dollars to park in a sketchy lot across the street.

Parking: Limited metered street or paid parking lot
Price: $8-$15 per person
Wait: 5-10 mins"
1,"I would really recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants soup dumpling, green onion pancake, fried dumplings or soup noodles in financial district. I love the fact that I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get good Chinese dishes. We ordered the soup dumplings and for once there was actually soup in it! It tasted so good! The fried pork dumplings were just as good, crispy on the outside and flavourful on the inside. We also ordered the pulled pork bao, that's the one I don't think is worth it. It was good but not great. The green onion pancake was ah-mazing! I think it might be the best I ever had. We also ordered the pork belly soup noodle and that was really good! The pork belly was my favourite! Overall I would give this restaurant 4/5. The restaurant can get busy really quick so the service might be a little slow. But other than that it was well worth it and the price is great! Definitely coming back when I am craving Chinese food."
3,"We went here for my brothers birthday.

I think there policy is a little silly. They only take reservations for groups of 6 or more. Since we were only 3 we had to wait. When we got there she told us 1.5 hours but it ended up being just shy of an hour. I dont get why they dont take reservations for all party sizes.

Decor wise, its a little weak. Nothing bad but nothing appealing either. 

Food was amazing. I didnt fill up at the salad bar but the things I did take from there were all good (avocado salad, couscous, cheese bread)

All the meats they brought were phenomenal, my favs were the flank steak, the bacon wrapped filet and of course the grilled pineapple. My least favs were the garlic rubbed steak -because it was incredibly salty... like beyond, and the shrimp. The shell is on so its hard to eat and when you finally do get to eat it its also very salty. 

For $45 bucks a person I would say the quality is definitely there, I dont know if you actually end up eatting as much as you think because they bring out the food so quickly and you keep saying yes and end up filling yourself up a lot quicker and on a lot less."
2,"They have great coffee but, I think there are much better place to eat in TO...though the location can be very convenient to the research crowd."
2,"This place was awesome and perfect for our Sunday afternoon stroll in the neighbourhood. Pierogies really are a comfort food and any place that can take a comfort food staple and step it up a notch is definitely worth a visit. Loaded Pierogi delivered! My husband and I \""splurged\"" by ordering the Donald Duck and the Surf n Turf. I found the portions just right - enough carb-heavy Perogies to crazy toppings. I warn you to the slightly confusing entrance because when we first got there we got seated for Hank's next door and had to leave to go to the right place. At least we had the decency to look embarrassed ;)"
2,"Best Dessert place. Food, service and Quality beat Cafe Demetres and other dessert places. Visitors and Resident of GTA - you MUST try this place."
2,"Dandylion has had such mixed reviews on yelp, but has consistently been on top lists of places to go in Toronto, we just had to check it out. It's a smaller restaurant with good ambience - plants everywhere, kind of feels like you walked into someone's apartment if it had been converted into a restaurant. The kitchen is open and visible at the back of the restaurant. The menu is limited, but the food is absolutely fantastic. We tried a little bit of everything - and everything was absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. The menu does change regularly - and i can't wait to go back to try something new!"
2,"Great experience. 

We went for the Sunday brunch buffet. There is a bit of a wait to get in even if you have a reservation. A small beach or cordoned off area for waiting would be nice as things seemed a bit disorganized there, but the wait was about 15 mins and I wasn't in a hurry so we weren't upset by that. 

The food was great - especially the pizza. So many options. Our server was fantastic. Cooks were friendly and helpful. Hostesses were distant but not rude. It was without a doubt busy, but I guess the above reasons are why. I would absolutely come back for brunch or evening drinks if this is what I can come to expect.

Oh - note to all Buffet eaters:
Please stay classy. Leave the Tupperware at home...."
2,"I've been here twice, both for birthday parties, and would not have come otherwise.

The place has a great mysterious ambience. It feels like you've been transported to some otherwordly place. The service was great and the food was delicious yet unfulfilling as I was still hungry afterwards. As for the belly dancing, how great was that? Good food and belly dancing, where else in the city can you get that combo?

Food: 4
Service: 4
Ambience: 10+++
Belly Dancing: 10+++
Overall: 4 of 5 stars (although I would only visit for birthdays or special occasions)"
2,"Giving it a 3.5 star on the food. The tacos are good. But I would stay away from the salad- didn't find it that great. I had the fish and beef tacos, both had great flavors. The decor I actually love. Thought it was very playful. The service was friendly but a little slow at times. Would come back again."
2,"I've only been here for their gelato (i.e. haven't tried their meals), but every time their service is great! They're really patient with their customers even when they have a line of people waiting and their portions are huge! Especially compared to other gelato stores.

Flavours were great - their fruit flavours/sorbets are pretty sweet."
2,"If you love Katsu curry, I would definitely check this place out.

They have a wide variety of katsu, so if you ever get bored of the same traditional flavours (how could you?), then you have 10 other unique styles and sauces here.

Parking sucks."
2,"actually 2 1/2 stars. Stopped in for a burger with a few buddies.The burger was good, the poutine was bad. The waitress was clueless. 
Overall just okay.
We would not return."
3,"Pretty sure this is the original location? Maybe I'm wrong... 
Chicken hot broth, very good soup. 
Wraps equally good. Great comfort food.
The challenge I find is the COST, it's a few bucks too expensive.
Good spot to a relatively dead turn in the street/area."
2,"To start off with, I was initially looking for a spot to have a beer and some chicken wings, however, this place isn't offering chicken wings, they offer cevapi. 

Growing up with numerous Eastern European friends, the word cevapi is synonymous with a great time. That being said, I was pleasantly delighted to know they are a pub that offers up some truly local beers and some very delicious Eastern European foods. I was in heaven. 

Moreover, ownership and employees really serve well. They are attentive, courteous and easy going. 

Overall experience has made this spot a go to for good food and a nice time out. 

Great choice."
2,"Authentic Israeli food from the family that run Sima restaurant in the incredible Mahane Yehudah market in Jerusalem. Shawarma, pargiyot (dark chicken skewers), kebab all fantastic. Rib steak good. Fried eggplant slices also very good. Hummus tasty. Provide 4 salads to start on the house, nice touch. Still waiting for an Israeli restaurant that provides unlimited small salads for a fixed fee, like in Israel. Whole wheat and regular Laffa very tasty. Food here tastes the closest to Israel outside of Israel."
2,"Absolutely fantastic!!! Went today for dinner and it was, dare I say, better than lunch. I had the spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese salad and the buffalo chicken. To top it all off raspberry compote cheesecake. The service was impeccable as always. Very quiet, but then it was a Monday night and kind of early."
3,"I'm not impressed. Drink menu is decent but everything here is boldly overpriced.

I ordered a dinner-sized Indian-style \""scroll\"" with spicy curried vegetables that was essentially a bland sop of mushy vegetables (mostly canned chick peas) wrapped in roti. Throw in a side salad and charge $18 for a most disappointing and mediocre meal. For all the naan fusion they boast I thought it would come out differently..... and yet most of the food we ordered was nothing special at all.

Nice ambience - the wooden outfit and candle-lit tables will make you freak if you factor in the possible \""cute date place!\"" designations. I don't really care for Kalendar, food is a first for me!"
2,"Really good Thai food with excellent service! The food is very flavourful! Even though it's quite small inside, the interior is designed beautifully. 

One of the best Thai restaurants I've tried in toronto. 

Definitely will be coming back again soon!"
2,"This restaurant was on my summer to-do list, so I made an early Saturday evening reservation - something I've discovered is best to do if you want to eat at a highly sought-after resto. 

I love how small and intimate the restaurant is. They also have tables to accommodate most party sizes if you're not more than 8 people which is a plus for a small place. The service was great and the food was brought out very quickly.

Since everything is made for sharing, we ordered 4 dishes and a dessert between two people and we were satisfied.

We started with the Crunchy Chinese Salad with plum dressing. I have to say it was probably the best salad I've ever had. It was really refreshing and light - a great way to start off the meal. 

We then ordered the Kimchi Pot stickers, a 1/2 order of the O.G. Fried Chicken, and the Jerk Pork belly. I was most looking forward to the pot stickers but I have to say I was sadly underwhelmed. They were good - that's all. I didn't find them to have enough kimchi flavour and the sriracha sour cream on top was nothing extraordinary.

The fried chicken on the other hand was awesome. The sauce they serve it with is a bit like the red sauce you get with Chinese take-out, but 1000x better because it finishes with a good kick of heat. The chicken is fresh and crunchy and not greasy at all.

Now for the pork belly. My boyfriend typically loves the stuff and I felt obligated to try something jerk-seasoned. I would give this a 5-star rating and best overall based on the flavour alone. It was just the right amount of spicy and their jerk seasoning was awesome! It felt very authentic to me. The only problem - and I'm no expert in pork belly so forgive me - was that I found it really heavy and the portion is almost too much for two people when you've ordered a few other things. 

For dessert, we ordered the coconut lime sorbet and it was the perfect way to end our meal. It was very refreshing and cleansed our palette of the rich pork belly that lead up to it.

As a side note - I ordered the bourbon lemonade as my cocktail. This felt a bit like they were trying to cheat their way out of making a true whisky sour, avoiding the whisked egg white and simple syrup and such. Just my thoughts"
3,"Only giving it 3 stars because my fiancé proposed to me on Valentine's Day here. The atmosphere was great. The live pianist was amazing. My fiancé requested our song when he did the surprise proposal. That was the best part. But this place is crazy expensive. $245 for a 3 course meal? Hell no! The food was eh. The salad with dates was good but the main dinner deal was salty. I got the steak and the potato thing was salty. The dessert was plain. 

The restaurant is very romantic. But the place is so small. You are so close to the person next to you. The waitress was kinda rude. After my fiancé proposed he came over and was like \""are you guys getting married\"" \""to him?\"" As if I'm making a mistake. 

Plus 18% tip on top of a $90 meal per person? Funny!"
2,"They've changed their menu a bit since the last time I was here. Luckily you can customize each burger to what you want. Though the sweet potato chips are gone. :( Anyway, before we used to always ask for our burger well done & they would never do it. This time they did. Sorry, I'm not a fan of semi-raw meat. I have the Village Bahabastard Lamb Burger & Hubby had the Big Smoke. It was all delicious. It started to get super busy as we were finishing our food so we hightailed it outta there as it's a small space."
1,"I only have one thing to say. Before I die I must come back for those blueberry pancakes. 

Service 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5 - casual, clean, trendy
Food 5/5
Price reasonable 

I suggest you make a reservation . On Sundays they don't take reservations so try to beat the rush and get there early, the wait might be 20mins but if you are there later it is 45mins to 1.5hrs *gaspppp* 

I really liked the pulled pork dish and the pancakes. Sometimes I dream about them. Mildreds is now one of my favourite places for brunch I can't wait to bring my other friends here!"
2,My go-to place for a lunch or dessert stop when catching up with family/friends. There's always seating when I come in and the airy atmosphere is stress relieving. I'm only giving 4 stars though because of the low selection of desserts during my most recent visit.
2,"I don't really do lineups for eggs, so I avoided this place for the longest time... And only really hurt myself. The backup breakfast next door is fine, but if you wake up early enough to avoid the backlog, this place does stuff with breakfast food that will make your weekend. Fave would be the cheddar spinach waffles, and a.m poutine is ridiculous. A must try. Must eat. Must still try to avoid lines."
2,"A great burger overall. Fresh meat. Great toppings. And it is absolutely the only place to eat truffle fries. Ever. I go pretty often and it is consistently great food
 The meat is fresh, the buns are pretty good for soaking up the juice and they can actually cook a burger to medium. Properly."
3,"This place is expensive as hell but damn, it's good. The atmosphere is awesome - you see the giant crabs and lobsters in tanks around the restaurant, the staff brings the crab and lobsters out for you to look at and take pictures with before preparing it in several ways. 

We selected a 5-person dinner and they prepared the famous lobster tower, crab fried rice, crab legs, lobster leg tower, etc. 

Honestly, it was overall a great experience and I would recommend everyone try it at least once for a special occasion!

They can get very busy, so I would recommend calling for reservation!"
2,"Celebrated my 24th birthday here with a fabulous Sunday dinner. Excellent service. Excellent food. 

Started with oysters Rockefeller with bacon and spinach. They make fresh bread from scratch, as well as all menu items. Everything was prepared to our liking and included great bite sized plates in between our meals. 

I enjoyed a 12 oz strip loin steak cooked medium-rare and served with Parmesan frites. 

Overall the experience was great and very enjoyable."
3,"I love love love Sage Cafe. But if you don't want to wait and don't want to be surrounded by pushy patrons, do not go right at lunch time. Any other time, this place is the bomb. The wraps are SOOOOOO good. Every single one that I have tried has been delicious. My favorite I think is the salmon dill one but honestly every single one you try will be good. It is a little expensive for a wrap sandwich but once in a while you can splurge. There are also some fancy drinks that you wouldn't be able to get at a regular 7/11."
2,"Every time I go to Five Guys, I wonder what their hot dog and grilled cheese sandwich taste like. But the cheeseburger always ends up winning the fight in my head, and I always end up ordering that...until now.

This time I ordered both the grilled cheese sandwich and the hot dog. I may have a problem with self control...but that's a different topic. Both these items can be topped with all the same toppings as the burgers. The grilled cheese is made with two inside-out burger buns with the sliced cheese in the middle. The hot dog is a large-sized wiener, made out of the usual miscellaneous meat mixture, bigger than the normal grocery store dogs but I don't think quite yet a foot long, and they cut it in half on the grill. They both taste as you would expect: yummy but nothing groundbreaking. Although I do think the inside-out burger buns on the grilled cheese is an ingenious idea.

So if you've been wondering what the grilled cheese or hot dog are like, there's your answer. I have a feeling not too many other people wonder that, because they screwed up my order while they were cooking it and it took extra long for me to get mine. They were nice about it though and compensated by giving me a free drink, without me even asking. I love Five Guys."
2,"Never again, will I come here, the staff here is terrible. - I've been here a few time and have so-so service but never anything to stop me from coming in. Today, I ordered a simple cup of Oatmeal and waited over twenty minutes for my order. The best part is the server decided to go on break and took my original order with him on his break. He sat five feet from me and chilled with it on his table instead of doing his job. When I asked someone else what happened to my order, they tracked it down on his table and tried giving it to me! Who does that?"
3,"I walked in here with my brother with very low expectations. The owner/worker was very welcoming and friendly. We ordered 2 mexican specials at 10.99$ each and a side of guacamole.

The food came out very quick on a hot plate and everything tasted quite good. The guacamole was made to order in a big cool pottery or stone kinda bowl. Very tasty I loved my beef Chimichanga. We left stuffed and both said we'd be returning as its local to our work area. I don't want to give a con point but I must admit I was shocked when he rang up the price, close to 40$ for 2 meals, 2 pops and the side guacamole."
2,"I love this place. 

The food is consistently excellent and hearty, comforting and filling (huge portions for great prices), no matter what I've ordered over the years. I've had maybe one server experience that wasn't that great, which pales in comparison to all the wonderful, attentive staff I've encountered. The ambience here is really cozy and cute, with the only drawbacks being occasional long waits bc of the size of the place/number of diners and being seated next to really loud parties, which has happened from time to time. 

I'm not a fan of loud, crowded places, but somehow House manages to turn packed into homey and fun. Feels like you're a part of something. I so much appreciate that the food is fine dining level w the relaxed atmosphere of a local pub. I never feel out of place here, and that's saying something!"
2,"Local ingredients, house made sauces, amazing beer selection. The stretch needed a place like this and ever since it launched, it has been popular - good to see."
1,"Originally wanted to go to Manpuku but forgot it was closed on Sundays so I came here instead. Despite being in a food court, they lined a few of the tables with red tablecloths and placed mini vases of flowers as the centerpiece. The atmosphere was very cute and the lady behind the cashier was kind and friendly.

I ordered the special Chicken Cesar Wrap and a side of garlic fries ($5.50) which was ready to eat within 5 minutes. The wrap itself was just mediocre with chunks of relatively tough chicken meat and lots of romaine lettuce. The fries were soft, starchy, and quite moist from the garlic oil as opposed to being crispy (which personally isn't my preference). There were also the occasional minced pieces of garlic which were tangy and spicy and left an unpleasant aftertaste.

Overall, I'd give the food a 3, the atmosphere a 4, and the pricing a 4. I wouldn't order the wrap again but I would like to come back on a weekday to try the $5 all day breakfast."
2,I would give it a half star if I could. This is pub food at it's worst. The burgers we ordered were too dry and overcooked and beer wasn't the greatest. Will not return.
2,"This place has great value and really well done Indian food. They really care about what they are making. I also really like that for dinner they have the option to do dinner for 2, 3 or more people which means you choose an app, a vegetarian main option and 2 meats for a flat rate and that also includes naan, rice and deserts. Perfect!"
2,"Bought the following:

Gourmet cheese burger, $7.99.
Mushroom burger, $9.99.
Philly cheese steak, $9.50.

Make it a combo: 
with salad or fries and drink, $3.99 each.

Classic poutine, $7.99.

All burgers/sandwich were gourmet-good.
Fries were ok but not crispy as advertised.

Caesar salad & coleslaw were ok; I can eat the burgers without these salads.

Place was clean.
Service was excellent."
2,"I'm giving Hero five stars not because it is charming or pleasant. But the quality is good, antibiotic free and it taste good and has been consistent every time I go, which is important to me. I'm not a fast food person typically but I decide to try it simply because of all the claims they make for being basic and healthy, clean food and no frills, they meet all 3 consistently. The service while usually very good, I would prefer if they would just take my order and try not to teach me their culture like star bucks. Extremely friendly staff, flawless service for what it is and can't seem to do enough for you. While it is fast food, they do post on the marketing that it can take up to five minutes to prepare your food. It always comes out piping hot. Five stars for attempting to deliver good healthy clean food on a consistent level. I find myself consistently dropping by for a quick tasty bite.."
2,"This is probably one of my favorite Korean BBQ locations, especially because it's close to home. 
During the winter months, my husband and I becomes pescatarian and this place is an awesome place for AYCE. The atmosphere is fun and exciting knowing that we are cooking our own food. 
The meats are all seasoned well and the marinade they use for the meats are so good. The side dishes - Bapsang are so good, from the kimchi, spicy bean sprouts, regular sprouts, marinated tofu, marinated potatoe, radish, to the beef broth everything taste so good

When love to take family and friends to this location because the staff are awesome, service is quick and everyone leaves stuffed and satisfied."
2,"we came for brunch on sunday, we wait for the food at least after the server took the order, we didn't get the food yet, so we ask the server how long we have to wait, the open kitchen is so small, and lots of orders came in at the same time, so we have to wait at least 45 mins. i have to cancel the food order cuz i was running late for another date. the service is good, but the food waiting time was disappointed."
3,"Being my first visit to Toronto I don't know of many places to go near the waterfront. This is not a bad place to visit if you're a tourist trying to see the waterfront. There is plenty of outdoor seating if the weather is nice out. 

I will say that I ordered only an appetizer because the meals were way overpriced. Even the apps are too much. I also was not impressed with the size of the appetizer I ordered or the quality of the food. So, I'm going to say that you can probably eat dinner somewhere better.

I would say this is the type of place to hop in for a beer or a drink just to see the atmosphere. I think there are too many excellent places to pick from in Toronto to eat at.

Overall- this isn't the best I've been to."
2,"We headed here for a late night dessert and coffee fix taking a suggestion of the server from the restaurant we had dinner at (crazy, I know!)... but it was truly fabulous!

The decor and atmosphere was absolutely stunning - it was unlike any other restaurant I've seen (almost like it was a house first before it became Wish). The service was fantastic! She suggested we try the Chocolate Ganache Brownie with homemade raspberry compote. And WOW - I \""WISH\"" this could be a daily indulgence! It was so delicious that the table next to us ordered it too - saying we were their inspiration! 

On a side note: the food menu looked pretty delectable, so we'll be back!"
3,"Tried a custom poke bowl before a greyhound bus ride as it seems to be quite the fade lately. I definitely enjoyed it! The food was fresh and healthy tasting and it was quick to order. The portions are quite large and definitely satisfying. It is on the expensive side though, I wasn't aware that a bunch of my toppings I was adding (ie seaweed salad and corn) is an additional $0.50 so my bowl ended up being $13 which was pricier than I imagined. I would come here again and order a signature dish though if I wanted something healthy."
2,High quality! The food is obviously cooked with love and the service is exceptional. This is a repeat!
2,"St Louis Bar & Grill is decent but this location is the worst bar and grill in Toronto and the employees are disgusting. Considering being located in a high tourist area this location is an absolute embarrassment to Toronto. Ordered online twice and the staff are not only racist but have no problem letting you know that if your coloured they will help white people first then ignore everyone else. I ordered for pickup and there is a sign on the door that says to go to the bar to get my food only to be ignored for 10 minutes then yelled at, yes yelled at \""your suppose to go to the server not here go to the server don't come here\"". There is a sign in the door that says to pickup online orders at the bar and I went to the bar, the racist bartender chose to play with her phone instead of assisting myself she kept texting until some white people showed up at the bar and she attended to them then went back to texting. When I asked for my food she yelled out \""your suppose to go to the server not here go to the server don't come here\"" then said \""sometimes we don't have enough servers\"" I said there is a sign in the window says to pickup online orders and the reply was \""go to the server not the bar\"" then I went to the server near the door and was told \""your order is being cooked\"" even though it said online that it would take 20 minutes and it was 34 minutes later and it wasn't busy. The server left and came back few minutes later and said they are packaging my food and left for 5 minutes. It takes 5 minutes to put a couple of chicken nuggets and 10 fries in a container. While waiting a older Chinese couple came in and wanted to sit and 2 servers walked by them 3 times and we're ignored and the couple left. A couple of white dudes showed up and we're asked by the same server if they want to sit outside and they went to the bar and the same bartender that told me to get lost served them right away. When I finally got my food home they screwed up my order. I only ordered food from this location twice the previous time was last year and pretty much the same thing happened I was told by the server to go to the bar and asked the bartender for my food and was ignored for 3 minutes then when I went to the server they had my food waiting at their station. Unless your a first class racist and hate people that aren't pure white according to Hitler's standards stay away from St. Louis Bar & Grill across from Rogers Centre as there are plenty of other places to eat and would be happy to serve you with respect."
2,"Yummy!! Get ready for a special treat but make sure you either have a big bib or a lot of napkins!!
If you like veal on a bun this is the place to try. You can make your sandwich to order from just veal to veal with sauce and all the toppings you like. The portions are huge so you can either split it into two meals or share with someone or opt to order the smaller size. 
I personally think price is high compared to a good burger but it is definitely a good change and treat. 
Wait wasn't long as they have a lot of people getting things together to get you going! I would definitely go back as a good lunch option."
2,Very fast efficient service and right next to our office. Fresh food and lots of healthy choices.
2,"Really tasty food, we ordered take-out a couple of days ago. The quesadilla fajitas was really tasty, if a little messy eating with your hands like I did, and the veggie tacos were very good too. We ended up without salsa for our tortilla chips, but they were nice and crisp, and the churros were a great end to the meal. Will have to take some friends along there in a couple of weeks, I think. :)"
2,"I went to this new location two days ago. Food was excellent however the service was not too good.

I felt the server was not very attentive and kept interrupting me while i was ordering.
The most disappointing thing was when I received the quinoa avocado salad, there was no avocado in it! And nobody told me when I was ordering the salad. I have been to so many restaurants but had never encountered anything like that. That was totally unacceptable. 

Afterwards, the server just said you can choose another ingredient in it but he never came back to check with us. 

In one word, their patio is really nice and a good place to gather in summer. However, the service really takes off lots of points for the restaurant."
2,"Pleasant and unpretentious cafe with friendly service and home baked goodies. Not the warmest interior, but still a nice place to hang out and read a book."
2,"Just dropped in today for the first time and the space looks beautiful! The staff are very kind and very friendly. I ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai and really enjoyed it. The taste, presentation, temperature, and texture were spot on. 

I was planning to eat in but I couldn't handle the music: it was adult contemporary cover duets. There were three of us in the restaurant, and all of us were waiting for takeout...just sayin'. 

My hope is that they nix the music altogether (especially anything with vocals), as it's very distracting and unnecessary, especially since the beautiful renovation and the food speak for themselves."
3,"Had an amazing salad and fish and chips here last year and tried to repeat that experience on two occasions but they failed me badly. A good place if you want to indulge in sports and happy hour but the food is overpriced, not worth it, and takes forever to come out."
2,"In the style of 'know what you can do, do it, and do it well' Great sports bar with wings and ribs. Take along a few friends, get a beer or two, or three a whole stack of wings or ribs, and chill Great evening out. Watch the sports on the various screens if you like, but the sound is down so they're not at all intrusive."
1,"I've heard about this place for a very long time from mutual friends and finally decided to check it out for brunch. The other reviewers aren't joking when they say that there can be a long wait, but it was definitely worth it. Had the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon and my friend has the 3 egg omelette. The eggs benedict was cooked perfectly and the portion size was very fair for the price. From the bites I had, I thought the omelette could have used a little bit more seasoning. It wasn't bad, just didn't do it for me. Overall, a great brunch place and I'd definitely come back with a few friends to try a more dishes on the menu.

Definitely check it out."
2,"The ramen is truly excellent here, and well worth waiting in queue outside to get a seat at this super-popular, no-reservations restaurant. The Tonkotsu Black, with roasted garlic oil, adds some exciting spice to a rich base. Service is quick, if impersonal; with so many customers waiting, one cannot really blame the servers for wanting to process the order and send you on your way in record time. I'll be back sometime to try the miso ramen. Only four stars, though, as there are no vegetarian options, which means I can never come here with my partner. I know that authentic ramen is by definition not vegetarian, but it would be nice to have at least one good option on the menu for our herbivorous friends and family."
3,"Great coffee, beautiful setting, but meh service. Robotic, zoned out, and not engaging. If I wanted that, just make your coffee slightly cheaper and self-serve. When I asked for a receipt, I was met with a blank stare.

Loved the huge condiments bar though. It was nice that there was that large of a space to dress up my coffee!"
1,"This place is cheap and cheery - and the staff is friendly to a fault. Service is brisk, sometimes frenetically so; the waitresses literally RUN from place to place.

My experience here actually was a somewhat poor one; as I ordered the raw wasabi octopus, and was promptly rewarded with an excruciating stomachache. It was my fault for ordering so adventurously though, and I suspect that my gastrointestinal distress was due mostly to my Americanised digestion system rather than a true case of food poisoning. Still, I eat pretty much anything without my body complaining - so unless you are blessed with an extraordinarily robust stomach, I'd stay away from that option.

Otherwise, the bowl of udon that I had was delicious, and the prices are cheap enough that you can try a bunch of menu options without putting too much of a dent in your wallet.

Be warned that takoyaki is made to order, so it's a twenty minute wait. The rushed schedule of office lunch hour precluded me from trying it this time, but will do so upon my next visit for sure."
2,"The food is very tasty and fresh. You choose the fish you wanna it, the sauce you wanna cook it with, and the cooking method. The bread, humos, baba gnoj, and salad are complimentry. Excellent customer service, and amazing of sea food taste.
The best!!"
3,"*3.5 stars

Its my second time going to Han Ba Tang with friends. One of my fave Korean bars. 

My group ordered chicken wings, mac n gochuchang and I had a peach beach. In my opinion, the price for the portions served are not really worth. The food were all pretty kind of spicy too (I was dying at every bite of my mac). My peach beach was made of peach liquor, soju, and vodka. I think this place is a good place to get beers and soju shots with friends. 

On a Friday night, this place gets loud! Even at around 1am, the waitress told us that it is usually more busy and the place more full too! Also everyone here working are attractive people lol. While not checking up on customers, some of then would take shots with regulars. 

The decor is also super cute."
2,"Second time visiting Fat Ninja Bite and this time didn't disappoint! Ordered the chicken katsu burger while my SO ordered the pork katsu on rice. The portion of this sandwich is insane! The crispy meat is twice as big as the bun. The katsu is double breaded with an egg wash coating before it hits the fryer. It's fresh, and definitely a sandwich that I won't ever share :P the sandwich is dressed with lettuce, tomato and pickle. It comes with a side of coleslaw and cabbage to cut the grease and adds a crunch. 

Parking may be a bit difficult to get here, I'd suggest parking along the side of the neighbouring Petro Canada gas station 

They also have bulgolgi, and übe ice cream"
2,"A small little place just a short walk East of Bathurst station. The staff are Chinese so it's not an authentic Japanese place but it's still good for what it is.

You go up to the cashier to order for take-out or dine-in. If you're dining in, you can take a seat and they'll bring the food to you. There's five big television screens in the place, generally playing kpop music videos.

The staff are still in training so they may make some mistakes but the owner or manager I presume is very nice and corrects the issues when you bring it up.

I had the curry chicken noodle and it was yummy but the portion size is a bit on the small side. With the combo, you get a small mochi with ice cream in the centre and a cup for soft drinks (unlimited refills). Their cheesecakes on display are also very small."
2,"Extensive beer collection, although I had a great cab Sauvignon with a bistro burger. Great duck fat fries that can be shared by your group."
3,"I've been to restaurants where all the servers are blind, so I thought coming to Signs would be a cool and different experience as well! As a person with 0 knowledge of American Sign Language, I learned quite a few new words at Signs that will forever be ingrained in my brain, so I'm appreciative of that. However, Signs itself was an okay restaurant.

We came by for dinner, and the deaf servers were accompanied by translators to help us with the order. The restaurant was quite empty when we were there, and the servers were efficient and attentive to our needs. We ordered food in sign language (using the handy-dandy guides on our menus) and we got our food quite quickly! 

It's actually quite an expensive affair for the size and quality of the food. Perhaps it's just what I ordered? Two main courses (no appetizers or desserts) + tax + tips became close to $60, which I was quite unhappy about. The Chicken Breast is bland, rather dry and definitely not worth $21, so don't bother getting it. The Seafood Gnocchi was chewy and hot with lots of seafood, but was ultimately quite pricey. 

I guess you could say you're paying more for the experience! It's a restaurant I will not be returning to; once is enough for me."
2,"We're lucky that in Toronto, excellent Cantonese restaurants like this are standard, rather than the exception. The food here is what you'd expect, great tasting, with big portions all at a reasonable price. What we didn't expect though, was the top notch service we got! You could really tell that they were trying their hardest to make us feel welcome as soon as we stepped into the restaurant, and the waitstaff were so friendly and attentive all throughout the meal. Recommended if you're looking for a good Cantonese restaurant with a clean and modern interior, and nice service."
2,"Lots of interesting dishes here! My friend and I shared the brussels sprouts, daikon radish and tempura salad, avocado/tuna tartare, salad rolls, and one of the specials, karaage chicken tacos. Brussels sprouts were great, almost candied with bacon. Tempura salad was good, dish used a unique kind of tempura - lots of veggies fried into a brick, rather than stand-alone pieces of vegetables. Spring rolls were good, although the tacos and tartare were just okay. Overall we were happy with the dishes and the portions. Unfortunately the service could have been better, it wasn't busy when we were there (a Wednesday night) but still seemed like we had to wave the servers down to make our order and to get the bill. I also didn't love the decorations on the walls, which were flashing neon lights, making it hard to concentrate on having a conversation. Overall a good dinner and I'd go back if I'm in the area - but not if I was in a hurry, and not if I had to sit in the area with the flashing neon!"
1,"Pleasant staff, decent food and fair prices, yet what might have been a perfect brunch on a warm summer Sunday today was considerably diminished by many wasps swarming the patio tables.

I was told the owners refuses to use wasp traps or even one of the effective fake wasp gadgets that keeps wasps away.
It's not even an expensive fix to protect diners so what's going on here?

It's a matter of time before someone gets stung and sues for damages.

Too bad, but shows a lack of care for customers!!

I down rated the place by two stars for that reason."
2,Downgrading to 3 stars. The food is consistently amazing but they can't seem to get an order right. I've had takeaway twice in the past few months and neither time has it been right.
1,"Bang for your buck. Delicious Mexican dish served up by super friendly staff. Came by Tuesday after work for take out. We ordered the Tabasco combo and the Mexican Combo which came up to around $25. The lady gave us a complimentary chip and salsa while we waited for our order which was super sweet of them.

Solid burrito, enchilada and chimichanga for what you're paying for. Great staff and service. I will be coming back."
2,"Went on a business lunch. 
Several people in the party wanted to try their steak frites which weren't on their lunch menu but the chef was able to accommodate on request. Nice gesture.

Had the fish and chips. Pretty standard but a little on the greasy side. I know, I know what else should I expect for fish n chips?!

Service was super attentive."
1,"I hate to say it but the Jerk Chicken here is not that good. Edible, somewhat tasty, but not good. This is no chicken cooked in spices until the chicken fell off the bone. The chicken was actually a bit dry and stuck on the bone with only seasoning on the outside. The rice and beans was okay. It was nice that they added two slices of plantain on the side that was relatively tasty. For $8+ tax, the price is reasonable but not great.

Nice, clean, and new with good service and ample seating for a small counter-serving restaurant. I dont hate it, but I don't love it."
2,"Favourite coffee shop in Cabbagetown. Adore the coffee, drinks, healthy and delicious salads and sandwiches....and the assortment of pastries. 

Oh, and did I mention the owners and staff couldn't be lovelier? 

Design nerds: you will appreciate the tiled counter and the reclaimed wood bar. And the colour palette :)"
1,"Definitely a huge selection of beer. So much so that it takes a while to find what you want to try. Reasonably priced, it's more of a place for beer lovers that enjoy a good beer. Not a place to get trashed. This place is classy, and the ambience was great. I only went in to try a few beers that caught my eye as this was my first time. The next time, I'll definitely get the sampler. One thing I noted was that on the way to the bathroom, there was a small high stool area overlooking the kitchen, and I THINK they must have something special goin' on there. Maybe food + beer pairings?"
2,"Girls night! When my friends come from out of town, we've got to go out for dinner, drinks and good times. I wanted to try somewhere I'd never been and Carbon Bar, at Queen and Church, had been on my list for awhile! Reservations were made and off we went. 

The unusually large entrance welcomed us as we were seated. High ceilings with sleek lighting greeted us with trendy, yet comfortable décor. At the front of the dining area is a large bar with seating all around with more fabulous lighting and wood accents. This place is on point! 

They offer signature cocktails which looked to be pretty popular. The beer menu was alright; all the good stuff was in bottles, but I was happy local beer was available. My friends laughed when I was served a 600ml bottle of Beau's. 

Time for eats! I ordered the Duck Tacos($18), mostly because I cannot say no to duck. The crispy duck flanked by THE smoothest guac and pineapple salsa ever. To die for. I ate all 3 before anyone had taken their first bites! One of my gal pals ordered the Summer Striploin($35). After taking her first bite, we had to ask her if she was OK, because her eyes rolled back in her head it was so good. Needless to say, she did not share. Another lovely lady, usually incredibly chatty, was completely silenced by the Prime Beef Brisket($25). The Jalapeno Corn Bread($8) was the only dish shared; great portion size! Warm and sweet with a little kick, this was divine smothered in whipped butter. 

Even after all of that food, us ladies kept room for dessert. A few of us got the Rocky Road Sundae($12) to share. The sundae had 2 large scoops of vanilla ice cream, surrounded by toasted marshmallows, candied hazelnuts and graham crackers and drizzled with chocolate and caramel. A few ladies went for the Banoffee Pie($12). It was interesting. It's small, but very shareable as it is very sweet. The cake tastes of bourbon and is topped with the banana brulee. It's a little off balance, the brulee dominating over the bourbon filling, but if you're not in to chocolate, this is a great dessert. 

The service was great. Food out in a reasonable amount of time and super friendly. Love it when you can joke with the staff! Sometimes it was hard to find our server, but it was pretty busy! 

Food was excellent! I'm already planning my next visit!"
3,"Pretty straight ahead wings - nice to be in a specialized place that is definitely no frills. A bit pricey, though, for what it is - worth a try at least once,,,"
2,Disgusting I saw the Cook while i was waiting for my food he dropped big spoon they use it for the fryer and he pick it up and keep using it like nothing happen and when i told him about that I thought they will take care of it right away but unfortunately they guy who did it its the owner and he tried to ignored me as much as he can but when i asked for my money he gave me back my money and instead of he apologize he told me never come back. Who in the right mind go back to a restaurant like that.
2,"Yummy!! I Was in Naples last summer and had the privilege to dine at pizzeria da Michele (google it!). Tonight's margherita pizza at pizza e pazzi brought back memories of last summer in Naples. If you can appreciate a true Napoli style pizza, come here! Only thing they could improve on is the surface of the tables... As they are strangely sticky. Otherwise fabulous!"
2,"As some others have mentioned, this place has changed English names several times but the Chinese name is still the same.

I came here recently in hopes they still had their lunch combos (~$7-8) that came with a grapefruit/peach green tea with tapioca..but those days seem to be gone now. The restaurant has been renovated with plenty of seating.

I ordered the pork rib ramen and beef teppan pepper rice (~$10-11). Both lunch combos came with a mason jar mug of refreshing and aromatic honey iced green tea. The food was delicious and portions were very reasonable. 

The service was pleasant as it was not busy, there were maybe 2-3 other tables at 2PM on a Friday.

They seem to be mainly focused on desserts, will be back to try the giant mountain of toast topped with ice cream as others have posted."
1,"Solid! I love this place, because it actually seems as though they care about the quality of the food they put out.

Got the Salmon Teriyaki+ Maki combo, and my mind was blown. 5 Appetizers to start: Japanese Salad, Rice Porridge, Miso Soup, Seafood Salad, and Jap Chae.

My bento featured the aforementioned Salmon Teriyaki, Spicy Tuna Maki, Pickled Radishes, and Agedashi Tofu. 

And a scoop of Green Tea Ice Cream to finish.

All for the amazing price of $12.95!!! I don't even know how they make money off of this. Such a steal, and everything is exquisitely delicious.

Love that I have a real deal Japanese place in my hood!"
2,"Delicious, and super friendly. The pineapple froyo is an awesome touch"
2,"This is a fine resto with a very friendly owner who calls me by name. Their hot oil dumplings (wonton in peanut sauce) is ethereal--a friend flies in from Calgary for these--and their shrimp with ginger and scallions, spicy peanut chicken, hot and sour are always first class. Always jammed at lunch (go before noon or after 1) but less crowded in the evening."
2,"While in Toronto for a few days, I had a hankering for fish and chips. The majority of other reviews are spot-on -- simply, very good fish and chips. I had the cod with poutine and breaded mushrooms. Based on the suggestion of the waitstaff, I tried both the extra crispy recipe in addition to the original recipe. Definitely try the extra crispy. Will repeat when back in town!"
3,"My husband and I tried this place after work on a Friday. The restaurant was mostly empty for the entirety of the time we were there, and it was quite cold by the windows (we needed to change seating due to this). The price point seemed reasonable until the actual food started arriving - other reviewers have commented on the value, and they were not exaggerating. The bruschetta was four tiny pieces, each about the size of a loonie, the tacos were two small 4 inch taco rounds, the dumplings, four small dumplings. This really is a 'cafe' type place, formica type booths, generic recessed lighting in the ceiling, cheap drink specials, so the price and sizing of the plates seemed so off-key, priced as though this were a higher end restaurant experience. It was tasty, but I doubt we'll return, as there are a boatload of restaurants with equally delicious plates of a better size and value within walking distance. The service was okay (we had problems getting our bill at the end) and the drinks were cheap."
2,Damn rude ass employee NAHID...old lady ..getting pissed off that I asked for everything yet she doesn't put spinach ...will not be returning
2,"Had dinner here yesterday
(March 15, 2016).

Beers on tap , $4-$5.50. 
Good selection, local & imported. 
Served cold!

Ordered: 
-chicken wings, $12.
-tuna poke, $13.
-fish and chips, $15.50. 
Very crispy batter.
-tortilla soup, $5.50

Overall, the food would have been ok if they were not salty! Even the tortillas were salty.

The ambiance was nice for drinking."
2,"Concept is the same as Burger Joint in New York, but it is definitely no where near as good. 

Its locate inside the Bottom Line and you can just walk straight to the back. I was expecting a long line around 12ish but I was literally the only person. The burger itself isn't bad, but very tiny (think the size of a cheeseburger from mcdonalds) and greasy, even though a burger should be a bit greasy. 

The fries were the worst part. All the fries were super soggy. Its disappointing because they were seasoned well, but just not crispy at all. I would not recommend nor come back."
2,"Hidden Valley Coconut Milk Tea is absolutely incredible, can't get enough of that coconut flavor. The staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful in helping me decide what to try, and the Cheesecake is a perfect compliment to the drinks. They also have a great selection of teas that they sell loose leaf so I picked up some to try to brew at home. Hopefully it will come out just as good. Definitely coming back to try some more of their milk teas, I just love that they use real milk and tea no powders. I hate the powder taste I get from other tea shops."
3,"I think the pastries here are definitely more gimmicky than traditional, and for the price ($5+ per croissant) it's a bit much. 

I will say the salted egg filling is good and comparable to what you would find at dimsum but it's just strange eating it with a pastry filling around it / not warm (I guess you could always warm it up yourself?) 

I find the pastry to filling ratio is a bit much on the filling side so it gets too sweet/too heavy. The croissant itself is not flakey at all due to having so much filling in it so it's not light and fluffy as a croissant should be."
2,Must have bad taste. But got a churro from here. Meh. Was not to amazed. I must return!
3,"Came here for lunch, pretty pricey, food quality isn't that good. The restaurant is quite empty when we arrive around 1pm. Wouldn't recommend to friends."
2,"The best shawarma i've had in Toronto. The meat is superior quality, they put the right amount of meat and sauce, and it's always busy (I.e. Fresh ingredients). My husband and I go out of our way to walk here."
2,"My first trip here was on one of the most coldest days of last year and I decided to come here for dessert haha. For the first time, I ordered the mango bingsoo, cup size and I shared that with my sibling. The \""snow\"" part was actually milk based, not iced like other shaved iced places which is good. The only part of what made me not want to return was the mango pieces. I felt like there were some fresh cut fruit and others that tasted plain weird. The pieces broke easily when I bit into it. You can compare that as if you are eating a apple, it did not taste right as if they had it in their container for a long time.

Second time I came and got the green tea bingsoo with my friend, it was much better than my initial experience. The injeolmi (soybean powder) complemented the shaved ice and green tea/matcha very well. I would return again to try their other menu items!"
1,"If you look past the specious claim that it is Toronto's #1 roti shop, I will concede that Coconut Grove is A-OK. It's tucked between a strip of similarly pocket-sized eateries along Dundas west of Bay street. Inside you'll find a sassy lady shelling out loads of curried meats: oxtail, beef, goat, chicken and stewfish and you can them with rice or roti'd. All the meat is Halal.

I went with the stewfish roti and asked for it spicy. It definitely packed a punch. I thought it was pretty good, though I probably wouldn't go fish again. Prices are pretty reasonable but note there is a $0.25 charge for debit, so you might want to bring cash.

Obligatory Title Pun: They've got a GROVEY thing going on.

Menu Readability: I don't even remember one.

Need to mention: Or 10 rotis and get your 11th free.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm not even remotely sassy."
1,"I've had a few burritos from Mission Burrito and have never been disappointed. The chicken burrito is my favourite. They offer various spice levels, but even the hottest isn't that hot. The burritos are prepared fairly quickly and the prices are very reasonable.

I have yet to figure out their hours so getting a burrito from Mission Burrito is a game of chance. I'm very impressed with how the single employee handles the stress of a line-up."
3,"After seeing a mouth-watering video about the Haam on IG, we decided to drop by on a Tuesday evening around 7pm. The restaurant was mostly full, but we were able to get a table for 4 immediately. 

The menu seems small at first, but it's clear that a lot of thought has been put into each dish. We were tempted by many of the options, but settled on the macboki, smoked duck ramen salad, popcorn shrimp, and duck bao. I would highly recommend eating family-style so that you get to try as many plates as possible. The fusion is done really well, but my favourite dish was definitely the ramen salad with truffle, mayo, and wasabi flavours.

Service was a little slow - we ordered the duck bao about halfway through our meal, and it did not arrive until about 15 minutes after we had finished the rest of our food. Price to portion ratio is a bit high, but definitely worth it. I loved that there were so many unique elements to the food, and it was a meal to remember."
2,"A solid 4+ star but with definite potential for 5-need to actually eat there first before deciding on a final score.

I popped in with two friends from work last week for post-work drinks. It was really busy on a Thursday evening at 6pm and we had no reservations. We were told there would be a 20min wait for a table so opted to sit at the bar while waiting. We don't often get to have sit-down chats in work so we were happy just to be sitting down together with a bottle of wine in front of us and quickly settled onto our stools.

We chose a pinot grigio between three of us which went down far too easily. Our barman was just fantastic. Friendly, chatty, topped up our glasses whenever they looked depleted and just smiled as we cackled together. He turned a blind eye to the fact that we were more Witches of Eastwick than Sex and the City and treated us like VIPs. We enjoyed the Prosecco he provided but blame the bubbles for slightly unsteady walking afterwards. We were offered our table after a little while but declined because we were so comfy and happy at the bar. It was fun! One of the waiters recommended that we try one of the desserts which we decided to have between us (if you share the calories don't count). It was divine! Kind of a butterscotch/salted mousse pudding which I think was called the butterscotch boudino. We were too busy groaning over it and pretending that we didn't want it all to ourselves to take much notice of the name. 

I love the setting in the MaRS building-it's really unexpected and is close to work for me. The exposed brickwork manages to make it both traditional and modern. We didn't eat a proper meal there but everyone I've spoken to is a fan. If it's as yummy as the dessert I think I'll be upgrading to 5 stars. The staff and the wine already deserved an enthusiastic, albeit slightly tipsy, 4!"
3,"Just wanted to add a few things:

1. Big Ass pole in middle of shop blocking counter. (See Photo)
2. Iced Cap($4.00+) is pricey but good.
3. Hard plastic seats I haven't seen in my other spots.
4. NEW Iced Aroma Float(Iced Espresso + Ice Cream $5.00+)
5. Patio space."
3,"Smokes has the best poutine I've ever had. I'm a vegetarian and absolutely love the veggie gravy there. My meat eating boyfriend has never even tried the meat gravy because the veggie gravy is so delicious. Love the mushrooms and onions too(even though I think an additional $1.50 for them is steep). 

Forever customer!"
2,"Now that Arepa has fully taken hold and people all over town are talking about \""that arepa place\, I have been back to see if things have changed. Shari's comment about a drop of coleslaw is correct- so for the price you get a small arepa and a tablespoon of coleslaw. That's still not gonna fill me up. The most recent trip there, i was really impressed with the quality of the octupus- texture and fresh lime flavor were great. To fill up, I also split the cachapa again. Not so special, I know what I'll be eating next time (2 octopus arepa)!"""
2,"I was here a week ago on a Saturday to celebrate my birthday. The place was packed. We were seated downstairs at a very funky wood table. There was 16 of us. All the food was delicious. I had fish special. It was delicious. Most guests ordered pasta dishes. Their feedback was also good. Fried calamari was amazing. We ordered pizzas for appetizers. They were also very good, thin crust. The stuff is very accommodating. We were allowed to bring our own cake and have separate bills which is awesome for a large party. The service was perfect: polite, knowledgeable, and timely. Louisa was our server and she was fantastic. I was running late to my own birthday party. When I called, the man on the phone told me not to worry and offered to put an order of pizza at a time as the guests arrive instead of bringing all the pizzas at once letting them get cold. That way even if the host is late, the guest will have fresh pizza to snack on as they arrive. I thought it was very kind and considerate of them, even though it would create more work for the kitchen to cook one pizza at a time. Will definitely be back!"
2,"I never came back here after my last experience with the service. However, their $3.99 Sapporo beer special and $1.99 bubble-tea signs outside their restaurant attracted both my hubby and I for lunch on a Sunday.

The lunch AYCE has some nice sushi options. They do lack a wide variety compared to other places I've been. The service was really good here but it did become slow a bit near the end. I also found the servers to be helpful and kind.

The sushi maki options on the AYCE menu were my favorite. I personally love the dynamite maki- fresh, big and yummy! Basically all the sushi options are good but other dishes suffered. The spicy salmon pizza is good but too oily and I've had better. The deep fried tofu was gross, the spring rolls were disgusting and the salmon teriyaki was okay-slightly salty. They also have a soup, salad and ice-cream bar. Both soup and salad were bland and boring. I did not get a chance to try the ice-cream. Sticking to the sushi options is the way to go.

Lunch AYCE- $13.99
Dinner AYCE- $18.99
5% discount if you pay cash. Free california rolls with any take-out order.

Overall, the AYCE at SushiO was a bit disappointing. However, the sushi was so good and the service did improve significantly compared to my last visit. I can see myself coming back for the yummy sushi!"
2,"We came here with a Groupon, and came on a Tuesday night.

Tuesdays: You can get a movie pass with your dinner for $6. Not bad.
Wednesdays: Get $15 off some wine bottles. Very not bad.

Ambience was neat: the strange thing is, you have to walk up to the cashier to put your order in. After that, it's table service. It's a neat place, like a sports bar mixed with Neapolitan style pizza, with pitchers of beer and bottles of wine available. Based on that, I was really excited to be there. Also, this place is loud. It didn't help that this guy behind me was talking extra loud because of loudness.

Service: It was good. She came and refilled our waters regularly and checked in on us.

Food: Inconsistent. My pizza tasted good, I'd say 3.5 out of 5. But I'd rather eat at other Neapolitan style pizzas around the city than here. Picea, Libretto, Queen Margherita, etc.

After I finished my pizza, my wife couldn't finish hers. So, I stepped in: pinch-eater. Sadly, she never tasted my pizza, and when I tried hers: it was awful. The tomato sauce had no taste, it was mushy, and had clumps of raw garlic and patches of salt.

In summary: Never say never, but the only reason I'd come here is if we were stuck in going there. E.g. weather and every other place is full/unavailable, friends really want to go, etc. Hopefully others have/had better experiences than we did."
2,"I happened to be passing through Little Italy, and decided to try out this landmark. My friends and I were not disappointed. We shared the Antipasto Misto, and it was reminiscent of antipasto plates I've had in Italy. For main, I had the veal- it was perfection. The service was awesome, our server was very attentive and took care to recommend wines to pair with our meals. It was my first time at Bar Italia, and I'll definitely be going back!"
3,"Taste of the food was good. However portion was a bit on the light side for the price they charge. Ordered the mixed seafood dinner which came with 3 jumbo shrimp, 2 scallops, and some kind of white fish. Tasted good."
2,"A great place before, in between or after shopping. A whole separate gluten free menu. Beautiful decor. Elevator for the second floor. Nice seating. A little loud but they don't rush u out the door. Nice bar and dining area. A great location, a must visit"
2,"This place never disappoints. One of my personal faves for dinner and brunch. The atmosphere is perfect. The staff and service is always friendly and personal but the best part is that the food is to die for. This place knows meat and uses a head to tail type approach but whats great is that their vegetarian dishes are also amazing. 

If you want flavour and a good time night or day this is the place to go. It a small spot so groups of 4 or more are tricky but its worth the wait.

Oh and I didn't even get to the fact that they single handedly brought back the picnic to Trinity Bellwoods with their $10 picnic baskets. Genius!

PS. Try their Scotch Bonnet hot sauce!"
2,Ordered the Gnocci with pesto and Fettuccine with Bolognese. We came here all the way from the US to try this pasta and it was fresh and great tasting!
2,"This review is for their brunch menu, which is fan-frigging-tastic. The way-too-chipper for 9am server/hostess was sweet and very French and very quick with the coffee (merci boucoup) and croissants. The croissants, by the way, were LEGENDARY. All flaky and buttery and sent down from heaven by angels themselves. Seriously. The croissant was so good, I moved on to the Croissant Benedict for the main attraction, which was also delicious. It's not the best benedict in town, but it's got a decent hollandaise and the eggs were perfectly oozy. What else can I say? One of the best breakfasts I've had so far in Toronto. I can't wait to come back to try their dinner."
2,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is delicious, in abundant quantities and always an interesting selection. It is a small, hole in the wall kind of place and the seating is limited. The have a backyard patio which is nice and quiet. The lamb wrap and the corn chowder soup are amongst my favoruite dishes."
3,"All aboard the hype train. 

Naturally, with all the attention this place has been getting I had to go see what all the fuss was about. $10 for a cheese flavoured sponge cake. For this price it had better be worth it. When you eat it fresh it is very nice and soft with almost a creamy inside. Tasted very good.

However, this is probably the last time I will have this cake. Its sure as hell is not worth $10 in my opinion and to wait in line for extended periods just to have a flavoured sponge cake is sure not worth the time and effort. 

Someone had got it for me so I'm glad I didn't have to wait outside in the cold.

Overall, I would say it is worth trying out if you have never tried it before but don't expect to be blown away because at the end of the day it really is just a sponge cake.

So everyone just needs to exit the hype train and go eat something else that's better because there is always better :)"
3,3.5*** great pasta selection. The place is always busy until very late and the atmosphere is lively. The pastas are generally delicious but are not huge and do not come with salad or any side dish despite being ~$15 a plate. The salads are way overpriced not to mention they charge $6-7 more for adding chicken....and it's still tiny. Still it's a nice place to go for pasta and pizza.
2,"Great place for drink, I will surely bring more friends over next time."
3,"Went here over the weekend for a large party. The location and atmosphere is great. Too bad the food was just ok. They had arranged a prix fix menu for us which had options for the veggies (aka ME!). 
App: Eggplant parm (I forget what they called it, but essentially eggplant parm). This was quite delicious... and LARGE The serving size was what I would expect for a main. I decided to eat the whole thing. Read on and you'll know why I was glad I did :/
Main: Fettuccini primavera... I literally only took one bite of my food. It was awful!!! The noodles were undercooked, there was like zero sauce and three (yes, 3) peas in my primavera which was described as cooked with tomato sauce and garden vegetables... I guess if you get technical about it, then 3 peas does count as vegetableS :/ The server brought out a plate full of sauce and veggies, but that doesn't exactly cook up the undercooked pasta noodles. Suffice to say, I'm glad I filled up on the eggplant parm. My sister ate a little more than I did and ended up with a stomach ache...
I ordered a cappuccino while waiting for the main to arrive because I can't really go out late at night any more... the server forgot about it and ended up asking me while I was picking at my main: \""Oh you ordered a cappuccino didn't you\""... why yes I did... 30 mins ago... Thank goodness I didn't fall asleep on the table. 
Dessert: Tiramisu (my husband ordered) and some kind of chocolate bomba thing...
OK so the tiramisu was the worst I've ever had. It was dry... Who has ever heard of a tiramisu being dry? we only took a bite because it was so gross. The bomba thing was passable... 
Overall, I would never ever come back here... The food was way over priced considering that the only edible thing was the appetizer. We weren't even offered to be comped for the pasta... so disappointing. The service was just ok and the food was terrible. The only good thing about this place is that it looks good... which doesn't go a long way on an empty stomach. Find another place... there are so many near by."
2,"It was my first time at Ruby Watchco and I was pretty excited about heading into this Lynn Crawford establishment with an interesting family-style dining concept. The restaurant only offers a set prix fixe menu and each day the offerings are different and unique.

The staff were super friendly at the front of house with little antlers on their heads and feeling the holiday spirit. Lynn Crawford was making sure things were running smoothly at the pass.

The decor inside is contemporary and it emits an intimate but familial atmosphere with the not-too-dim lighting and tables with a cushiony booth against the wall. 

Our menu for the night was:

a. a starter of Ruby Watchco caesar salad that was really fresh. It had this really tangy caesar dressing along with the crispy bacon, crunchy croutons, 

b. the entree was a really long braised (24hr) pork belly with two whole deep-fried soft-boiled eggs sitting in a thick and creamy crab meat hollandaise sauce. The meal was surrounded with 3 sides: oven-roasted squash, mashed sweet potatoes, and some other roasted veggies.

It was a meal that was fit for a winter night provided by the combined weight of the pork belly, soft-boiled egg, and the creamy hollandaise sauce. The soft-boiled egged was lightly deep-fried and coated in a crunchy tempura like coating while the hollandaise sauce was filled with crab meat. Absolutely liberal and generous use of the crab meat. Yum.

Only hiccup with the meal was that the pork belly was braised with the thick skin on top. When we tried to cut it with the knife, the skin doesn't cut easily but the weight of the cutting kinda smushed the rest of the pork belly and it just kinda went splat into the plate.

c. the entree was followed by a nice cheese plate and was full of savoury goodness. It was complemented by some jams and other things.

d. the dessert was a really delicious and rich slice of bread pudding. We each got our own plate and it was a great cap off to a fantastic meal for the night.

I would come back here again but would definitely visit their website to see if the menu du jour peeks for interest and appetite."
2,"The place is well maintained. The staff seems to be really nice and friendly. Ingredient wise, the salmon and tuna that I had was fresh. However, it felt a bit too greasy for me."
2,Great for watching a sports game over drinks. The kitchen is slow and the food is mediocre.
2,Love it! Was checking out St. Lawrence market around lunchtime and stopped in here for grilled sardines salad. The sardines were fresh and had a lovely smoky flavor from the grill and the salad was fresh with an appropriate amount of delicious dressing. If I ever visit Toronto again I'd totally return!
2,"I'm not going to lie, one of the main reasons why I can't move away from The Danforth is The Big Carrot. I've been grocery shopping here religiously for the past 4 years and love the convenience of having such a great shop so close to home.

The main reasons why I love The Carrot so much are:
- they carry only organic and non gmo food
- they have a great reputation so I know I'm not getting conventional products in organic boxes (I've seen this happen with my own eyes at a small fruit market up the street where the employee added conventional berries in an organic box!!)
- everyone that I've encountered working here has always been really helpful and pleasant 
- they have a great selection of everything from produce to cleaning supplies, I especially love trying the different products they carry in their beauty care department and their ice cream selection :D
- they have a dispensary and juice bar for those super lazy days
- they make amazing soups and have quite a selection of ready to eat dishes *if your coming for soup go early they sell out everyday 
- they have a points card so you can collect points on every dollar when you shop *if you don't have a card make sure to ask for one at the customer service desk before shopping that way you can have your points added on right away, also BYOB (bring your own bags) and receive extra points!
- I usually bring my grocery buggy to push my groceries home and always leave it with customer service when I come into the store and its always waiting for me when its time to cash out 

I admit I price check when I go to different shops and the prices here are pretty standard with other shops carrying organic/non gmo items. A lot of the times I've found items here, which were a lot cheaper than others... So don't be fooled by what you read from others, it isn't too pricey to shop here and even if you still think it is, think of it this way... You are what you eat."
2,Excellent. Go there if you like Tapas/small plates. Great wines. Amazing location and ambience.
2,"3.5 stars 

- Female here on business, needed quick dinner. Love sushi. 

-ordered two rolls and a seaweed salad. 
- service was friendly and quick, not similar to other negative reviews.
-Green tea was delicious 
-clean and modern 
-food was yummy, not the best sushi in the world but definitely did the trick for a quick dinner 
-would return."
3,"I needed something quick to eat on my way to the subway, and I had never tried anything from Picnic (though I'd walked by it countless times), so I figured I'd pop in and grab a sandwich.

I eventually decided to go with their Spicy Chicken sandwich (\""12 Grain Bread, Spicy Chicken Mix, Sriracha Aioli, Romaine Lettuce, and Sundried Tomatoes\"").

It's fine, I guess. It was competently assembled and the bread tasted reasonably fresh, but it pretty much had mediocre written all over it. The big problem here is the lack of flavor: it didn't really taste like anything. Really, the most predominant flavor here was the bread, followed closely by the Romaine. The Spicy Chicken filling was so bland that it didn't really make any kind of an impression.

And for almost $9, I honestly didn't feel like I was getting a whole lot of bang for my buck."
2,Really nice service and a good place to sit with friends and char for hours (which is what we did). I had a delicious rainbow trout entree with a super pineapple salsa and creamy mashed potatoes. Sooo good!
2,"Love it! Bf and I got fried squid to start and it was fresh and everything squid should be.

The restaurant has a local brewery make a special beer to pair with their food and we both had (a few) pints. Didn't disappoint.

I ordered the fish sandwich and bf got the fish dinner. The fish was totally delicious, soft and fresh for both of us; mine came on a dense yummy bun that was perfectly sturdy to contain the large portion of fish. 

We finished off the meal with the little donuts which were freshly made and a great way to end the experience. 

We had great service from the bartender who was also our server. As other reviews mentioned it was busy but I thought staff handled it well. Not sure if the earlier reviews should be chalked up to the hiccups that ordinarily accompany a new restaurant but we had an awesome experience. I'm already recommending the heck out of it to friends!"
2,Peep deez FRITES. Big portions and good food. Wouldn't recommend the panko crusted steamed bao though.
2,"Came here in the summer, and it really is the best Fish and Chips in the city!

It is a tiny little shop with limited patio seating, so snag a spot if you see one, or head to a nearby park if you can! Because they make everything fresh, it can take a couple of minutes for your food to be ready, but it's worth the wait. 

The fish is lightly battered, perfectly crispy, and moist in the middle. The french fries are crispy and lightly salted, which made for perfect poutine (that didn't instantly get soggy). Most importantly, everything is hot and fresh! 

I will definitely be back to try the po-boy and for more fish and chips!"
2,"One of the best spots in Toronto for delicious Afghani / Pakistani food! Kebabs, Nihari, Kahari, Haleem are all great. Naans are baked fresh. They just renovated and expanded as well, so the space is much nicer and bigger now."
2,"I went here with three other friends. The service we received was really bad. The first guy who took our order was ok, not descriptive, sort of out of it and very mellowed out. Then this other girl came to serve us. She was the main problem. Extremely rude and annoyed the whole time. After receiving the food, we had to ask her something about the menu as we were confused what was coming with the order. It was a normal question a person eating at a Resturant may ask the person serving. She walked away thinking I was done when I wasn't. I was very polite because I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt - may be she had a bad day or something - she was consistently rude. Horrible horrible service. Oh and the food ... very dry and below average. Horrible experience"
2,"The food was so good I had to say \""this is so good\"" after each bite! Delicious food, friendly staff, cold beer, what else do you need? The decoration is not fancy but it's very authentic. Yes maybe they can start renewing their water bottles but overall it's a place I want to go back!"
2,"Saw that the Westin Harbor Castle wanted $22 for a clubhouse, so decided to grab an Uber and see what else I could find in the financial district. 

This place is very cozy, with great - and quick - service. Full of people clearly on break from towers in the area, but no big groups creating noise the day we were there. 

The clubhouse sandwiches ordered by the table next to us looked absolutely delicious, and were massive. Huge chunks of turkey breast. Definitely wish I had ordered that instead of the grilled cheese, which they do on a sweet dark rye bread. 

Beware of menus you find online - the one I found, which I think was linked by Yelp - was out of date. The Tuna Melt is no longer available!!"
2,"Get drunk. Go to The Burger's Priest. Get the double cheeseburger. Die a little bit inside while attempting not to weep tears of burgery, delicious joy."
2,"This place isn't dairy, gluten or vegan-friendly. My partner couldn't eat anything without risk of gut inflammation. After eating their standard eggs, sausage (it wasn't a \""sausage\"" per say but rather the grounding of the meat without the casein), potatoes and homemade bread, I started to feel sick and ended up in the bathroom for 10 minutes at a different establishment.

My partner would have been fine if they were able to cook the eggs, sausage, and potatoes separately on a pan without the use of butter, but they were not able to accommodate. So, I felt really bad and ended up cooking him lunch at my house. 

The cappuccino was not special for the $4.50 price tag. It was served in a regular coffee mug with lots of foam topped, almost spilling out. I am not expecting Italy, but there are other establishments that can serve way better cappuccino for half the price. 

I really hope breakfast establishments focus on being diet-friendly to people that are dairy and gluten sensitive. I mean, I am OK, but I watch out for my partner's needs, too. We should have gone to dim sum, haha."
3,"Very swanky looking place. Very well designed and decorated. Lots of space for large groups including an entire second floor that looks like an amazing space to entertain engagement parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties, or corporate holiday parties. I didn't read too many reviews of people having dinner here as it seems many people come here for coffee and their pastry bar. For dinner, the food is pretty good, crowd is very hip and full of yuppies, service is pretty good but price is not so much.

Atmosphere 5/5
Taste 3/5
Price 2/5
Service 5/5

Atmosphere - Had dinner here on a Monday night with a group of 6. We couldn't make a reservation online as this place was not on open table so we just showed up. There was tons of seating and they were very cozy. They did not cheap out on comfortable chairs and lounge areas at all. 

Taste - I ordered the ravioli which was interesting as it was made with carrot and ricotta cheese sprinkled with hazelnuts and rosemary on top. Interesting flavours. I wasn't quite satisfied with the cheese though. Wish they had offered to sprinkle some cheese on top as well. My friends mentioned the pizzas were excellent but the risotto not so much. 

Price - The ravioli I ordered was $18 which is pretty typical for a swanky place like this. It is a little overpriced given the amount of food you get with this dish. What I don't like is that the first option for tip when you pay using the credit/debit machine is 18%. 

Service - The staff here are all pretty professional starting right from the moment you step into this place. They greet you at the door, fill your water and always check back. They don't take too long to give you the menu, take your order and serve the food. The billing process was quick and easy and everyone is really friendly here. It seems like they may have implemented a really good customer service principles here."
2,"Have a spacious private parking lot, located close to Highway 401, spacious dining area, quick service, and most importantly, great food!

I have been here twice, both for dessert and coffee, but I heard good things about their savory items. Love their cannolis, available in two sizes (large and small, with a dollar difference). Their cream puffs are okay but nothing too special about it. They also sell one-day-old pastries in a bag for a cheaper price. 

Overall, a solid bakery. It has been there for a while and always busy (good signs). I would recommend this place to anyone near this area for decent desserts and also Italian hot meals for a quick bite!"
2,"Very friendly & Organized. 
If people looking for the Healthier choices, I highly recommend to check it out."
2,"We went to Toronto in early June. The weather is fantastic with sun shining everyday. We came with the expectation of trying out some great Chinese foods in Toronto. 

We were not disappointed with the restaurants in Toronto. Lai Wah Heen is one the best Chinese restaurants in Downtown Toronto. We had dim sum with our friends on a week day. With my friend booking it a day before, we have no trouble of getting seated upon arrival at the restaurant. We ordered our favorite Hong Kong dim sums including glutinous rice, pan fried turnip cake, crispy fried noodle with seafood and egg tart. One bite, I felt I am back in Hong Kong. The dim sum taste here is just as good as in Hong Kong. No wonder Toronto has such a good reputation for Chinese food. 

In addition to the good food, the environment and services matched the high standard of food. The restaurant is on the second floor of the downtown Double Tree Inn hotel. You wouldn't hear the loud noise of a typical dim sum restaurant in China town. The waiters are very attended and alert. They change plates for you frequently and refill the teas without asking. We definitely will go back when we visit Toronto again."
3,"How does this place manage to stay open? Their hours seem so random, the seating capacity is limited, and the food is mediocre at best.

The negatives:
- Already mentioned above and;
- Slightly Overpriced
- Slow service
- Service staff is blah

The pros:
- Location

I don't know why the stayed from the good ol' Logan Grill. That place was great and I had such high expectations for Hammersmith's. It could be so much more than what it is. For breakfast, Mad Dog's is a far better option, better menu, better prices, friendly staff, outdoor seating too, great coffee."
2,"Seoulicious is a huge downgrade from the prior restaurant of the same location, Danji. Although a much more 'modern' interior, it struggles to deliver the quality of Korean food that is expected, especially from a restaurant that is named after the capital of Korea. Seoulicious maintained the Japanese fusion style of Danji; they now serve a Japanese style salad commonly seen in Japanese restaurants, but I have to say it does not have any freshness (understandable considering they have all their appetizers pre-made and the salad soaked in dressing before it's served)."
1,Food was fine. Beer is cheap and a fairly good. Ambiance is just ok. Service was ok.
2,Delicious food and cozy atmosphere. Went for both lunch and dinner for different occasions. Will definitely return again.
2,"I hosted my birthday party this past April at Casa Manila. I had been having a great amount of difficulty finding a Toronto brunch venue for a 30+ group size. I had been to Casa Manila a few times before for dinner with friends and when I reached out to inquire about brunch, I was esctastic to discover that they hosted a Sunday brunch buffet with their top menu selections. 

Mila was my contact and she was AMAZING. So thoughtful, so caring, and very attentive to details. She was also very patient with me as I organized and waited for confirmations.

We had some unforeseen personal emergencies that happened on the morning of the event and Mila was incredibly understanding and accommodating.

Upon arrival everything was setup perfectly and my group was able to sit together, despite our size.

Food was ready for us as well and was absolutely delicious! I had several guests with a diverse array of dietary restrictions (including vegetarian and no pork). Every single guest complimented the selection and quality of food. We all left with fully satisfied bellies.

I personally loved the fish, chicken adobo, pancit, garlic rice and congee.

Staff were all friendly and took care of us. Separate bills were also no problem - taken care of with ease and no stress.

There is ample free parking in front, behind and below. The location is great if you have people coming from all ends of the city and GTA. Lastly the buffet price was excellent as well.

I would absolutely recommend Casa Manila for your next gathering.

Thank you so much Mila and the team for a very memorable birthday!"
2,Went with a group of 5 before a Toronto Rock game so it was pretty busy. The server was a bit overwhelmed and told us the kitchen was behind. This led to two of us getting really cold food. However despite those cons the server was friendly and the food was really good (just cold). I had the crispy lasagna which was a fun and tasty take on a classic. Definitely will go back but hopefully to warmwr food!
1,"At $5-6 (tax included) per crepe, you truly cannot go wrong! This is a hidden gem right behind the hospital on Dundas."
2,A group of 5 of us went after working @ the CNE Casino until the wee hours of the morning to have breakfast before heading to bed....The place has a lot of character and looks like it has seen better days but the reputation for the quality of foods allows most to overlook the decor or lack there of... I had an incredible appetite and ordered The Ossington Massive... It was all I expected and then some...Service was very good and the entire group was impressed with their breakfasts as well...
2,"I like beer, I like pinball. The combination of the two? Obviously better. Good crowd, good vibes."
2,"I came here for Winterlicious for the second time and it was awesome. We were a bit early so we had some drinks at the bar. We tried the champagne cocktails and they really hit you but I don't think I'd get them again. They came to get us after and we asked the waiter for sangria which wasn't on the menu, but he made it for us, and it was delish. This time they didn't serve us bread, but my meal was pretty filling. I had the mac n cheese, the braised beef cheeks, and the cookies n creme tiramisu. Everything was so good and the portion size was perfect. I noticed the mac n cheese was smaller than last time and the dessert was bigger. No complaints though. They finished with a huge bowl of cotton candy. It is honestly my FAV place for Winterlicious and definitely think everyone should go. There's so many options for people's tastes."
2,"What is not to love at Dr. G's!? I love the place so much that each time my meal arrives I exclaim: The Dr is IN!

This is an establishment that clearly understands what constitutes good service and good food. Simple, healthy food without pretension. We go for the burgers, pasta specials and the in-house hot sauce known as 'Angry Sauce.' 

I will see you tonight for dinner, Dr.!"
2,"Had dinner here, we ordered chefs sushi, deep fried seabream, one of their specials, sukiyaki and an avodcado roll. The sushi is fresh and delicious with an excellent variety of fish available. The quality is much better than the knock off sushi places."
2,What a great recommendation from a random woman named Diane at the free Elise Legrow concert last night downtown tDot that we stumbled on to so (serendipity) who sent us to Patria. Thanks stranger. An insiders tip. Made our day. This place is tucked away so we'd not have seen it. Wine was great. Food was even better. Would go back in a New York minute.
3,"I came here on a recent trip to Toronto after seeing the Yelp reviews. I got the Japanese Special which is a crepe filled with green tea ice cream, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. It was delicious!

The place itself is pretty small, with 2-3 tables. I did feel like the item I got was a bit overpriced, but I really enjoyed it and would get it again. 

Great place to stop in for a treat!"
3,"The place screams average. Portions are small and don't match the price. The food is not fresh. For e.g. they have their chicken cooked and a \""bucket\"" of butter chicken/paneer sauce sitting on the counter which they add on the chicken/paneer when you order. Shouldn't they be cooking the chicken in the sauce? No wonder the flavour is not there. The food is loaded with cayenne/red chili powder, gave me heart burn the rest of the day. The owner is not friendly. And the worst part, there were only 2 tables occupied in the restaurant and still they took 25 minutes to bring us our food. (we ordered 3 rolls in total) I don't understand why they take that long when they don't even cook the food fresh. Much better options in the area. I'd choose Kothur any day over TKRE. They're just across the street.

********************************************************************************
EDIT - The owner (presumably) sent me a personal message the same day I posted this review. Please read :)

Love how he comments on my appetite and guts. Lol. 
********************************************************************************

Dear Mr Vin,

Sorry to know that your experience at Kathi Roll was average.

You dont have a picture so I dont when did you come to our store.However I was keen to reply to your review :

The place screams average. Portions are small and don't match the price. 

We have priced our portions very competitively,though we cant contest an appetite.

The food is not fresh.
The Food is 100% fresh,and that contradicts your review it took us 25 minutes to bring your food.Why would we have to sit on your food for 25 minutes.

The food is loaded with cayenne/red chili powder, gave me heart burn the rest of the day. 
Butter Chicken doesnt have Cayenne Pepper,as we know the spices that we use.

The owner is not friendly. 
Would like to understand ,why do you feel so.

Much better options in the area. I'd choose Kothur any day over TKRE. 
You are more than welcome to choose any other option over us as you have formed an opinion.

We welcome reviews ,criticism and suggestions.Because of our customers ,their suggestions ,understanding their needs and providing them service,we have been able to reach this far today with over 100 k rolls sold withover 60 k customers in our store.

However we cannot appreciate the customer who doesn't have the guts to come and talk to restaurant staff directly,to let them know about their service & their product,and give them an opportunity to rectify their mistake if any.You may be perfect,we are not ,we try to do our best and try to succeed most of the times.

Thanks,

Kathi Roll Express"
3,I came here for the lemon meringue cheesecake. It's no longer there. Also the menu prices have changed. I got the small crab spaghetti for 18.95. don't trust the menu photos. For that price I would have gotten the full for 4 dollars more. There was one inch of crab in it. Never coming back.
2,"We love brunch, so when we popped by the atmosphere was very inviting and the food was completely satisfying. We had the Breakfast Pocket w/ home fries (incredibly filling), and the Cinnamon French Toast with poached bosc pear (Fantastic). The menu easily warrants another visit for us because there's just so much to try!! I was on the fence between the daily special of an omelette with spinach, kale and Swiss chard 

The Coffee was tasty and the service was good, keep in mind it's cash only when you go. Definitely recommend!"
2,"One of my favourite places to buy meats on the Danforth. The meat selection is great and the staff are really knowledgeable. Stock-in-Trade also makes their own sausages and sandwiches, which are amazing! Keep up the great work."
2,"Good food. Great location. Nice people. I have a great time everytime I go. Free Mimosa's on Mother's Day for the ladies. Belgian waffles are delicious, tasty green apple slaw and really good granola dish. It's the first place I think of when I want to take my friend's out for brunch!"
2,"I LOVE this place but I HATE the food. I've never been so excited to have an esports bar in Toronto before and this place makes my inner geek happy. Their chairs were so comfortable and there's an awesome pit with computers and a huge screen. I feel at home here. The staff is extremely nice and welcoming. However... the food. Please please change your cooks or menu..I don't know, just make it better. I love this place but the food is pushing me and my friends away. The food just tastes like microwaved food with salt. I really want this bar to be successful and very popular but that can't happen with crappy food. Please I beg you just please invest on good food."
3,"The fact that I await for a cold day in Toronto so that I can have even more of an excuse to go here explains my rating of 5. Their ramen rivals the stuff I had in Japan. If you go, you should go big and order their premium ramen. It is a bit pricier but worth it all the way. In the meantime, it is lunchtime at work and I am going to keep dreaming of those delicious noodles and that savoury tender pork..."
2,"I love this place. So tiny and cute, doesn't seem to fit more than 10 tables if that. It has been at this same location for about 18 years which is incredible for any restaurant along the college strip which has a notorious turnover rate. That shows this is a classic. It is a very chill atmosphere, that being said don't go of your in a rush because service is amazing in the sense they take the time to speak to tables individually for awhile, however it can make it a legnthy dining experience. I love all the menue options- all great options for amazing pricing. This is definitely worth checking out when in this neck of the woods- it's one of my new fave breakfast joints without a doubt!"
2,"Keeping it short, had an amazing experience at the restaurant while on a business trip. Service was great, very friendly and had excellent suggestions. The decor was nice and the food was fantastic. Whenever I'm in Toronto again, I am coming here."
1,"We only come for dim sum. Early for the special prices, later if we can't wake up. Either way, the quality and consistency of all dim sum dishes is very reliable."
2,"The service was ok, food seemed to focus and centre around ice cream Sundaes, that turned out to be bigger than we expected. With them being incredibly sweet we were unable to finish them because they were way to sweet and rich, keep in mind I usually enjoy sweet desserts. It wasn't the worst dessert I've had but it is no where near the best, mediocre at best. If you were in the area this is a place you can keep in mind, but don't expect much. I probably wouldn't go back here."
2,"Mouthgasmic. I fell in love and I want to tell the world!

Stopped by for a quick bite and everyone was surprised to see that I've never had banh mi boys before. I've heard great things and bad things about banh mi boys (mostly bad things from my viet gang telling me it's not even close to real banh mi) 

The line was a bit long but it moved quickly and there was a large space to wait for your food. There are tons of options and even for vegetarians/vegans...YASSS!!! I got the tofu banh mi and it was so flavourful, my tastebuds went for their own trip. The tofu didn't even taste like tofu, the mushroom sauce and lemongrass flavour made it soo delish. Also got the tofu kimchi fries and HOLY SHIIIIIZZZZZNIZZLES.. I think I passed out and came back alive. Fries didn't feel soggy from the kimchi, and the tofu slices were huge. Did I mention, I fucking love tofu? Oh man, the flavours made me want to commit sins. 

110% am going to return to banh mi boys. No doubt."
2,They serve a worthy Steak - Frites with a very tasty brandy peppercorn sauce. It can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is but overall great value and good service.
2,"This was our first stop in Toronto after getting into town. We heard raves about it and thought this would be good start to the trip. 

This swanky loud dark hipster eatery playing lounge music with communal tables was all about sharing. We went there late and still had to cue up outside. Thankfully, it wasn't cold. The wooden table topped with wax dripped candelabras. The food was of eclectic but mainly Asian. The cocktails were just as good. While some have raved about the Korean Fried chicken(Bonchon NYC) was certainly good but by no means the best I've had. The pork buns were equally as good but again wasn't the best(Ippudo NYC). That aside Snack Bar is a vibrant fun place to hang out with friends with food and drinks that are pretty darn good."
2,"The side dishes here are amazing. 5/5.
there are usually 7 dishes. My favorite side dishes are their eggplant and sweet potatoes. 

Their vegetable wrap comes with a variety of vegetables including perilla leaves, steamed cabbage, kale, romaine lettuce etc. It is a must try! Just a note, they do offer raw garlic and chilli slices upon request.

In terms of soup, I really enjoyed their ox knee cartilage soup and pork bone soup. Although the ox knee cartilage soupthe not as milky coloured as some other places, it is quite good still. 

This place is my favorite Korean restaurant"
1,"Excellent fish and chips. I'm from the UK and have lived in Toronto for 16 years and this is the only one that finally nails it. Fresh, great quality fish and chips and good portions to justify the price, which turns out to be very reasonable based on what you get. Well done. We'll be back."
2,The best chili chicken in town. Love the chicken in hot pot as well. Hakka Yueh Tung Special chow me in is awesome. Also enjoyed their chicken balls - sweet & sour sauce is delicious. Renovation is awesome and good never disappoints. Been a customer since they were located across the road before the current condo was built.
2,Hot beef patties are to die for! The coco bread is really yummy too. I can't wait to try the extra spicy beef and the chicken patties! I will be back again and again and again...
2,"Have been to this restaurant a couple of times for lunch and the food was just okay -- not terrible, but not terribly exciting either. A safe (and perhaps somewhat boring) choice if I am in the neighbourhood and want some easy food. Having recently walked by the restaurant and discovered that it was given a facelift, I decided to give it another shot. From outside, the new look of the restaurant seems to strive for a modern feel. As soon as I walked inside, I was promptly greeted by the waitstaff who appeared smiley and warm. As soon as I saw the menu, however, I realized that it was the same menu from before; although the selections were relatively abundant, nothing stood out as a must-have either. I ended up ordering a sushi dinner special -- about $16 and included some watery salad, a bowl of mediocre miso soup, and a dozen pieces of sushi. I can't quite tell whether the tuna that's on my tuna maki was fresh or not since my palate was completely overwhelmed by the large sum of wasabi that was placed between the fish and rice. Thankfully my whole dinning experience was single-handedly salvaged by my lovely dinner companion, but chances are I won't be back to Bikkuri any time soon."
3,"I went to this place for dinner. Although the ambiance is very romantic, dim lighting, jazz music, and not very crowded so kinda cozy, the food leaves alot to be desired.

We ordered the grilled eggplant which was OK. It had some goatcheese and came in the shape of a sandwich with pieces of pear stuffed in the middle. The whole thing was drizzled in olive oil and drenched with pine nut pesto. I don't recall what else was in it - the whole dish was very unmemorable. Price tag $10.

We then ordered two dishes for the main. Georges bank cod file cornmeal crusted with lemon thyme/olive oil roasted tomatoes. The fish was fresh and it was crispy. But there was no flavor to the dish. Very bland. Price tag $21.

We also ordered the duck breast. The meat was ok. Overcooked for my taste. The waiter did not even ask how I wanted it cooked. There was not much flavor to the duck breast. It was much worst than the duck breast from chinatown or what i had in a mom and pop resto in Paris. It was served with a sweet potatoe mash which sage, concord grape rosemary reduction - sounds all fancy but basically it was some weird tasting sweet potatoe - huge disappointment, and a side of dark purple looking sweet sauce - the whole dish was not memorable either. Edible but nothing to write home about. Price tag - $19.

We also ordered two glasses of red wine by the glass which were decent. 

The bill came to around $85-90. The service was ok. There are somethings money can't buy, in this case, it was an out of this world food experience. Everything was meh...very disappointing.

I don't think I will be going back. I've had better, esp for that price. I noticed on the way out they had a microwave in the kitchen. Who knows what that is used for. Hopefully not for reheating something pre-prepared."
1,"Had the Steak Frites and Buttermilk fried chicken burger. I have to give it credit for the burger looking like the picture on advertisement. Often the disparity is so great, here not so much. Service was fine, location was good. Nice place for a sit down lunch. Steak Frites was interesting. Few bites of steak with lots of fries, almost as if the steak was the side. Beef was chewy. Fried chicken burger was good, pretty good deal with a beer for $15."
2,"STOP walking or searching because you've found it !! Maison House of Church - WONDERFUL ! This location has been a number of places over the years and I've enjoyed them all, but now it's Maison House and it beats all the others to date !!

Today. visiting Maison House was truly enjoyable - the new owner has spent a great deal of money and time on This new place - they've renovated everything inside and out and it sure shows ! The same owner also (a women) owns SMITH and WISH - isn't it funny that those are another two of my favourite places around the neighbourhood. 

Today we just went in for cocktails on the wonderful patio I'm guessing maybe 20-25 tables on the patios, with a nice long bar that seats about 10 and there is a lovely long upholstered seat that runs for about 40 feet at side of the patio, and a great vantage point to see and be seen. Very comfortable and a wonderful place to have cocktails and a bite to eat ! Inside is about eight tables a nice long bar, a huge blackboard with menu items and drink items - all in all - very eclectic - white, and a modern looking space. 

They have a number of drink specials that really looks yummy like the nice Mojito with fresh mint leaves, raw sugar and Havana club rum and a Cucumber Ginger Fizz, Margaritas and the Sangria looked amazing ! But we had spicy double Caesars, and they were wonderful. We did notice a great deal of food at other tables - fish tacos looked very popular, and I think on the next visit those might be in order. They also have three kinds of burgers sweet sausage with sauerkraut and chicken fingers..... But truthfully all the orders that were coming out looked amazing!"
2,"2.5 review. 

First impressions: modern, trendy decorn clean, good variety and seemed like food would be good. Food is good but....
 
But service was terrible.

In a nutshell, we were there for over an hour, and sooo many things went wrong.

Pros:
- good clean atmosphere
- friendly staff
- seems to have very good takeout and delivery business (I tried it before, and it was good)
- recommended dishes based on our order (I wanted crispy beef and my boyfriend wanted general tao chicken, but he recommeded the pad thai as they were similar flavours)
- large portions and food was pretty good
- lots of variety on menu

Cons:
- very disorganized (we got served by three different people, including the manager)
- lots of walking back and forth empty handed
- when we asked our server what a certain dish meant, he didn't know and had to ask
- the server was holding onto the back of this chair where my bf hung his leather jacket (I.e touching it with greasy hands)
 - we ordered tea, an appetizer and main dishes. after waiting 20 mins Apps and Mains came together, and Tea came later only after I said something
 - asked for hot water in the teapot, and they forgot
- server came over to ask us how things are only after 20 mins and when we pretty much finished our meal
 - benches need cushions, and hurt my bum

They had 2 main servers, and 1 busboy type who seemed not to be busy enough, but made it look like it by straightening chairs and placing napkins on each table. It's a bit awkward; at the same time there's nothing wrong with bringing cutlery to the table after patrons have ordered that's appropriate for what their eating. 
The servers spent too much time dealing with delivery and takeout orders, and they need to have a designated person to do that. 

The more I'm unhappy,the more I notice things that was going wrong. They need more training on their staff. To be more aware of each patron, and maybe it would help if they didn't space out the tables so much (i.e. one table all the way at the end, and one table all the way at the back). It's disappointing because I think this yonge and dundas location really caters to a good niche crowd of after shopping groups who are looking for a casual quick lunch/dinner that's not as fancy as spring rolls, but unfortunately, if they don't step up their service game, most first timers won't come back. 
And this isn't specific to this location, friends who have gone to the yonge/wellsely location have said the same thing. 

They need to pick up some speed to get the lunch time crowd, or this franchaise will be short lived.

1,"Mr. Chu is a nice, inexpensive snack that hits the spot - just under $5! It's a food truck located just west of Finch and Yonge (on Finch) and it's bright yellow so it's easy to find.

A Korean friend told me that the difference between regular churros and Korean ones is that they use glutinous rice flour - to be honest I didn't taste much difference so not sure how much they use? But this was delicious anyway! It comes out piping hot as it is freshly made and is a little difficult to hold because it's so tall. I got Nutella with sprinkles but you can get it with condensed milk, oreo, and almonds as well. You can also get it with ice cream (which I will try next time) but it was delicious in and of itself as well. 

The guys who work there were also super friendly and helpful while explaining how the ordering process worked. I'll definitely have this again when I'm in the area!"
2,"A friend of mine included Scaramouche in his list of possible Michelin Star contenders in Toronto, alongside the likes of Alo and Chabrol. My expectations were set pretty high, and they didn't come close.

I'm giving four stars simply because I feel it's unfair to give any decent fine dining establishment a three-star rating. With that said, I wouldn't recommend it, nor was I blown away by the food or service. 

The venue and atmosphere, however, were impressive. It's in a very unassuming old condo building, so when you walk into the actual restaurant you'll be pleasantly surprised. 

Our server was, frankly, very poor. My sister asked to try wine that he recommended and he declined. I am flour free (not gluten free) and asked if there was a substitute for a specific part a dish, and he recommended another dish. He eventually made accommodations, but took awhile to understand. We also waited extensively to take our orders, and we weren't asked once how our meal was. He kept trying to up-sell us wine, and it just became awkward. Perhaps he was new, but these are the little things you expect at a fine dining establishment.

We had the lobster, the scallops, and the filet mignon. The lobster was a bit cold and not super flavourful, the scallops were nice but not extraordinary, the filet mignon was good. The potatoes with the filet mignon were outstanding, as was the sauce and beans. 

I'm aware I'm being very critical, but if I was the owner I'd want to hear about these experiences, and do whatever I could to improve them."
2,"Love this place - it's has the best latte in the area. So far I've tried the latte, coffee, cookies and pizza there. All were very good - except the coffee that I personally found to be watery in taste. Sticking to my latte next time!!! 

Have to thank @grasshoppereats for this great recommendation on her social media, as I would have never know about this cafe otherwise as it is hidden in a office/commercial-like building. The owner is always there, and juggling all the orders, super efficient and always asks how things are.

Looking forward to trying the pasta next time. It will be my 4th visit by then! :)"
2,"Finally tried this place. 
I'll say it straight out, I don't like or can handle hot/spicy food. 
This place was the wrong place for me.
All the meat is marinated in hot stuff. So I wasn't able to adjust the heat ... I ended up eating the cheese quesadilla. 
They have a bar of hot sauces. I didn't go near it.
Everyone else seemed to enjoy it.
They have great in-house made tortilla chips. 
That's all I can say. 
Would I go back? Nah."
1,Shopping on queen west and stopped by for a quick dinner bite. Decor is nice. Surprisingly not busy or filled dining area for a saturday night dt. Presentation of food was really nice. The food itself was mediocre - nothing special. Very reasonable price point. Would come back to try their pastries/dessert!
3,"I'm not sure why as a vegetarian I was invited to brunch here or why I agreed to go (whoops!). Its true, the aroma of smoked fish and meat hits you like a brick. 

They DO have a few veg options, but being a smokehouse it doesn't even seem to make much sense. I do not recommend this place for vegetarians. 

The meat eaters I was with seemed to really enjoy their brunch and if duck eggs are your thing you will love this place. The prices are a bit high as others have stated but I think this simply reflects the quality of the food. FYI brunch with a coffee will cost you around $20 and is served until 3pm."
3,"I'll start off by saying, I did enjoy the French Onion Soup I ordered. It was labelled market price, which turned out to be $15 (for a small portion). Can't really fault them for this, because I could've asked. 

The reason I am rating this restaurant 1 star is because of the atrocious service I received. I would like to preface this by saying, I don't give a crap about service most of the time. I am all for neglectful waiters, as long as my food is good. But this place deserves a special mention.

We had a group of 5 people show up on a Tuesday night. It was almost 9:30pm at this point, and the restaurant was mostly empty. We were just looking for something warm up ourselves with. Tea, wine, soup. We did not order any entrees, so I'll admit our spend was low. That being said, they had an empty bar and there were more than enough seats left at the restaurant. 

Within 10-minutes after receiving our orders. The waiter comes by and tells us a \""group had called and will be coming soon\"" and presented us with our bill. Basically, asking us to leave asap and he was \""apologetic\"". Like I said earlier, we were a low spend group. I get why they needed to kick us out and not lose business. We agreed without an issue, and said we would try to finish up fast or leave as soon as the group gets here. 

We asked the waiter to split our bill. He said, they do not \""split for a party of our size\"
2,"My friends and I had had been looking for a Korean BBQ place and happened upon this place. Luckily we got there early, cause within 15-20 min after there was a line out the door. 
We all got the AYCE BBQ, and so glad we did. The staff was very helpful, despite all the reviews I read here. They were constantly filling our water and green tea, and walking by to see if we wanted to order more. And to top it off they were extremely pleasant which made out experience at this place even more worth it. We all enjoyed the grilling experience, and the food was delicious. 
They don't rush you out of the place, we were almost there for three hours. It does get a little loud in the restaurant after a while."
2,The thing I love most about this establishment is the consistency in their dishes. I can always stop by on a Friday afternoon and get my favourite Ramen (miso) just the way I like it!
3,"For a fast food chain, this is serviceable food. The various ingredients are within view and you can build you own burrito/quesadilla/tacos. I view this as a North American chain and not a Mexican chain. I know. They sell Mexican dishes such as tacos and quesadillas but these are not authentic Mx. And don't get me started on burritos, an American invention!

At any rate, this is relatively simple food that can satiate any craving. I had a tortilla soup (definitely not the authentic kind, but I wanted a small soup) and a cheese quesadilla. 

Expensive fast food compared to Mc Donald's but never regrets when eaten."
2,"Lamesa is not quite there yet. I am not a Filipino but have some exposure to Filipino food and like it. Did not order the sissig as it was not made with pigs ears. The waitress did not inform me that fried pata was good for sharing with 3-4 people. Consequently, I had to have it packed and also asked for the spicy sauce that came with it. I was surprised to find at home about 5 ml of the sauce!! I have never seen cheap behavior like this in Filipino restaurants before. The Jackfruit creme brulee was very interesting, but the serving could have escaped from a tasting menu. They obiously need more staff. One waitress and a bartender can't possibly keep up. Would I go again? Probably not, unless these issues are addressed. Is anyone listening?"
2,"I could be sitting down to the best meal on the planet but if the service is arrogant and pretentious it makes it taste like dog poo. But the meal was underwhelming. Pasta was less than el dente (IT crackled). We were told that the chef didn't believe in the following - balsamic, butter, salt, cream or even allowing us to have our steak cooked to OUR liking. The meals were tepid and under seasoned. The olive oil tasted close to rancid. And the waitress whispered through the specials and took over 30mins to take our dessert order then promptly pressured us out of our seats for the next victims. Will never go back. Change your attitude. PRETENTIOUS came to mind regularly."
2,"Marcello's is pretty tucked in and if it was for a friend who took me here. I don't think I would have found it. Solid 3.5 stars. We can here for lunch and the food was buffet style by weight. I selected the fish and it was jerk fish and a regular fish. Both flavour were good and nicely marinated.
If I remember how to walk back here, I will go back by myself!"
2,"I got the spring roll as the appetizer, nth special won't try again. For the main, I tried the Basil with egg and beef, it is pretty spicy but it's really good. Highly recommend if you are okay with spicy food. also got the Gaeng panang, which is kind of like curry with fish. Curry is more on the sweet side, the fish has a crispy crunch to it; overall above average but would like to try other things on the menu next time. For the drink, I got the Thai milk tea. Little bit sweet but I like it. Probably would come again."
1,"I adore this place- it's where white people go to feel snobby and rich when they really aren't.

The food is incredible, worth the price for sure. The staff is generally very helpful and they're very good at helping you pick if you can't choose. 

One important thing to note: if you bring your kids here, you're a tool and I dislike you. This is a very nice restaurant, quiet, classy and romantic...do not spoil it with your loud annoying kids...get a sitter."
2,"I'd describe this place as one of the best independent coffee shops in Toronto in regards to the product they create, however some of the staff and the regulars are kind of off putting. I went there daily for several years yet still kind of got a cold vibe from the staff, they weren't overly cheerful. Perhaps because I'm not a hipster doofus (just a doofus) I didn't really feel welcome. So if you are just grabbing a coffee to go this place would be like a 5 star rating when you factor in the in shop experience it's just ok."
1,Great place and great service! And the prices are actually not bad at all. Good for dates and nights out
2,"yummy, yummy in my tummy. This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto currently. The ribs are double the price compared to the southern USA, but everything was delicious and nicely presented. This is the best substitute for my rib craving in Toronto. 

Barque has a great ambiance too. The place was packed on Saturday night. The beer seleciton is limited (mostly St. Ambroise), but the options were good.

desserts are also great and the staff are top notch. 

I would go back here."
1,"Their pizza is perfectly textured straight out of the oven. But if you wait too long to eat the pizza, it does lose some of that texture and gets soft and dense. Highly recommend to dine in rather than bring home. Beef carpaccio, kale salad are great starters, the prix fixe deal is excellent value. Desserts are very tasty, too. Nice servers. Very kid-friendly. Our 6- and 9-year old were made to feel welcome and even got to sit at the bar for a half hour to entertain themselves with soft drink sipping."
3,"We parked to have a desperate \""Hangry Brunch\"" at the Lakeview, which I'm really not a fan of, but extreme measures were necessary. The wait was 30 minutes and we couldn't do it. We would have killed one another.

Having already paid for parking, we ventured down Ossington in search of... pretty much anything. Happily, we wound up at The Saint and we were very glad, indeed. There was no wait for a table. Awesome. The first time I'd been to the Saint, I found it overpriced and the servers to be heavy on the hipster ennui.

This time, I had the BEST BACON OF MY LIFE.

Yes, this was the very best bacon I've ever had. And it came in one fat strip on my Brunch Salad. Perfectly rendered, thick as a two by four and wonderfully smoked, I was in love. 

I would come back here just for the $5 Caesars and a plate of that goddamn bacon.

In other news, the Benny was enjoyed by my boyfriend. He liked the cheddar biscuit, and the hollandaise was great. The ham nestled in between was a bit of a disappointing portion, but overall, very tasty.

Service was good.
The Bacon was better.

Bacon.

That is all."
2,"As a Ryerson student, I've frequented this location several times and I gotta say, I've consistently been disappointed by the horrible service that I've gotten here. It's perhaps been the worst I've ever gotten from any fast food chain! The food is borderline acceptable but the service is just terrible. 

Every staff member here is rude, has attitude, and gives off what is commonly known as \""the bitch face\"". From every interaction, whether it be with the employees or even (presumably) the boss, I get a very strong feeling that they don't want to be there and that they hate their jobs. I came here because of their new launch of the \""build your own bowl\"" concept and when I asked the cashier questions about \""what rice do you use, brown or white?\"
2,"They have got some kinks to work out. This weekend was the official opening so they were giving away six oysters for each drink ordered, which was a nice touch.

At this point in time, I would avoid this place as allergies are a concern for us. We asked when ordering our drinks about a specific item and then got a different answer from our server who finally took our order about 20 minutes later. I think they forgot to assign a server initially to our large group - even though the restaurant was not full.

Restaurant was clean including the spacious individual washrooms.

For dinner I will try to remember everything we ordered:
\""Free\"" oysters - fresh, decent
Ebi mayo - my favourite thing on the menu
Bulgogi tacos - also a winner
Grilled squid - a hit
Rainbow salmon - I passed on this but it was popular at the table
Kalbe ribs - similar to the ones we get from Costco, good
Takoyaki- a bit chewy at the end, but good
Lobster dream roll - a delicious but overpriced cucumber roll (could barely taste the lobster)
Yam fries - good
Japaburger - without condiments for the kids, meh"
3,"One of the best Indian food around the area. Like the butter chicken roti. 

Call in advance as there is about a 15 min wait.

Prices are a bit on the high side, but I feel that you get what you pay for here."
2,"Blackened salmon, more like burnt salmon. When asked to do over it was medium rare, had to take it to go to cook it myself."
2,So delicious and they were super accommodating to my dairy intolerance! They were super busy at lunch though and we had to wait awhile to get our food (1 hour).
2,"Amazing Japanese casual comfort food. Very generous portion sizes, comfy minimalist interior, and very nice staff.
My new favourite neighbourhood casual lunch and dinner spot. I've been here a number of times and it hasn't disappointed yet.
Highly recommended!!!"
2,"Awesome Roti! What a little gem! Not greasy and super tasty, highly recommend getting the hot sauce!"
1,"More like 4.5 stars. I have been coming back to this poke bar time and time again when i crave for something healthy and fresh salmon. I always get their Lazy California bowl with either half brown rice and zoodles(zuchinni noodles) or all zoodles with salmon, cucumber, crab salad, pickled ginger, tobiko, green onion, crispy onion, Lawai'a sauce and sriracha mayo. I love the seasoning they put on the salmon that seeps into the noodles/rice cause its so flavourful. You also have the option of building your own poke bowl which is good if you want to customize it. I enjoy all the toppings in this poke bowl especially the crab salad! If you get all zoodles I recommend you eat it right away or very soon after cause it gets all soggy and wet. The place is small but very modern looking with marble on the tables and part of the walls. They also carry some ELXR drinks. I got the activated charcoal lemonade flavour in the name of After Party. From time to time I crave the lazy cali bowl and that is what keeps me coming back for more. Prices are Little - $8.95
Regular - $11.95 Kahuna - $14.95 both for classic bowls and customized bowls. I need to go back and try the other poke bowls but for now Im happy with the lazy cali =)"
2,"Orietta has been hiding something: it's gorgeous little cafe tucked away in the alley beside the main restaurant. With heaps of takeaway goodies like Italian baking, focaccia & panini sandwiches, spinach crostata, bomboloni and pizza, they look poised to give Forno a run for their money. The coffee can be a tad bitter for my tastes and they don't offer cream, but they do serve almond milk and cold pressed juices. The real highlight here is the stunning space and the staff, who are exceptional. There's even a gorgeous event space upstairs you can rent out, and that they'll soon have open to patrons who need a quieter spot to work during the day. I'm sure the patio will be great in summer, too. A brilliant addition to the neighbourhood!"
2,"Decided to come here with a friends recommendation for a yummy Thai restaurant. I had to wait past the busy dinner time (9pm) to be able to talk to someone on the phone (otherwise it's a voicemail) to make a reservation. 

My friend and I were there first and were served water and we were able to order drinks (Thai Iced Tea, really good) while we waited for the rest of the party to come. By this time it was just starting to get busy with the dinner rush, but it never got ridiculously loud that we weren't able to talk comfortably. When the rest came, drinks were ordered and my friend who does not like drinking sugary drinks was able to order a mango shake no sugar. 

We were never rushed to order but our waitress came in to check on us and make sure our water was full. I ordered the Khao Soi, the others ordered: Pork belly Gaeng Hunglay, and the others ordered the Pad Thai. I found my dish quite heavy to say, I am more used to eating curry with rice so eating noodles got a bit messy. Would I order this again? Yes, but maybe switch for rice. My friends enjoyed their dish and it was all very yummy.

We stayed a bit longer then usual, but they never seemed bothered or annoyed that we were staying after paying for the bill. In fact, they made sure we had water refilled. I love when restaurants don't feel the need to kick customers out, we were catching up and were having a great time.

Overall, great customer service & great food."
2,"Had a variety of dishes, and there was not a single one I didn't love! Food was impeccable, service was great! Try the Cuban grilled corn and guava BBQ beef short rib!"
3,"To be honest, prior to coming to Lee I was extremely skeptical of all restaurants that were \""fusion\"". Fusion to me seemed more like you couldn't master either cuisine, so just decided to put the two together and heck, maybe it'll taste alright. 

This restaurant was a testament to the fact that fusion could be mind-blowingly delicious, perfectly aesthetic and so very hip. 

Highly recommend the following: 
Lemon & Oolong Tea Edamame, I have never had Edamame so savoury in my life before. The lemon and oolong was so refreshing and complemented the texture of the peas so well. 

Susur's Signature Singaporean-style Slaw, I know everyone is raving about this slaw, but believe me, there's a reason for it. Just by the appearance itself, it certainly is the most elaborate slaw I have ever seen. Stacked up, it was around 20-30 cm in height. The server told us there were 20 ingredients inside, including tulips? Despite the smorgasbord of ingredients, the taste was simple, elegant and very fresh. 

Caramelized Black Cod, consists of Cantonese preserves, miso mustard, dim sum turnip cake. Who knew turnip cake could be served with cod? Once again, the combination does not seem intuitive at all, but the taste was perfection. 

The service was amazing. It was obvious that all the servers knew the dishes inside and out. When the server were explaining to us the Singaporean slaw, it literally felt like he was spewing gold out of his mouth. After going through the menu, I was honestly so tempted to just order EVERYTHING. 

The price is steep here, but so worth it. 
Genius, absolutely genius. Will be coming back as soon as my wallet recovers."
3,"2.5*

Came here for Macaron Day and ended up buying half a dozen more besides the free one I got. It wasn't until we went elsewhere that we realized that was a bit of a mistake. Don't get me wrong, they tasted good. But they were small, expensive ($2.35 each) and not as good as many other bakeries I've tried. Maybe I'm spoiled from living right by Patisserie 27 but I definitely wished I'd picked up more at places besides here.

The store was nice, the staff friendly, and the cake samples looked pretty cool. I imagine actual cakes are their specialty so I wouldn't judge them too harshly on this experience."
3,"Eek! Methinks not.
The food is overpriced and gross. They have something they claim is ramen (maybe they don't know any better), but of course it was overpriced by a lot and I could see it was not ramen noodles so we passed.
The chicken was so bland and mushy (yucky) that it was unbelievable. Normally when a food melts in your mouth it is a good thing but this felt like it was gross and pre-chewed. At those prices they can afford to serve good food, but it is a food court in Eaton Centre for transients so of course they won't. 
Disgusting and expensive."
2,"We specifically went out of our way to buy a gift card for this restaurant to give to a friend. Their website states that gift cards are available in store and when we walked in and asked to purchase one the woman there flat out said \""No\"". 

Also the location, specifically the parking lot, is not kept in very nice condition. We expected much more."
3,"Was at the Bier Markt with some friends this weekend (8 of us in total) for their Fondue Festival.. We were all looking forward to the cheesy goodness but were all sadly disappointed.

My Boyfriend and I ordered the Brie and Lobster $23, and the Normandy $23. 
Another couple ordered Gorgonzola, all in all we all order all the main fondues that were featured. Not a single person was impressed with result. 

Our Normandy came first, all you could taste was Mustard. No cheese flavour came out.. the \""fresh baguette\"" were cold and untoasted, plain white cold baguette was unappealing.. you were given two skewers with three one inch slices of a sausage, which was hardly filling but was the only item that tasted someone decent.. The small portion of green apples were also lacking. 

The second fondue that came which we were looking forward to was the Lobster and Brie. Sadly again tasteless. ice cold fingerling potatoes slightly mushed, cherry tomatoes and again cold plain white baguette. with four tiny lobster croquettes ..this is $23? not worth it. again flavourless and extremely disappointed. 

My friend's Gorgonzola came and we thought for sure it was be full of flavour.. it tasted like Rue. Could not pick out any sharp taste you would expect from Gorgonzola... needless to say she was extremely upset. 

The only redeeming item we had that night was the beer.. although my second drink came with an extra seasoning of old lipgloss stuck to the rim of my glass.. Not mine that's for sure, I wasn't wearing any sort of lipstick or lip balm or anything! Gross!! - you'd think i'd get a discount out of it? .. nothing.

For two people, for two fondue orders, and two beer each... came to $88.86 Tax and gratuity already included (a 15% tacked onto the bill without even a word)

MAKE NOTE!!! Check your bill.. they add on 15% even if you think the service is good or terrible. 

Let's say this.. Go there only for Beer.. but check your glasses as soon as it is placed down in front of you. Do not bother ordering food unless you have no tastebuds. 

Fondue, a definitely SKIP IT!"
1,The food was quite good but what really stood out at TORCH was the impeccable service. Orders came out quickly and our server (and presumed owner) was very accommodating and friendly. The sushi and dons were tasty and priced accordingly but what will keep me coming back is the amazing staff.
1,"What a pleasant surprise! We were in the area on a Saturday afternoon in need of a lunch. This place totally hit the spot. The fish was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and has solid fries. We had the haddock and the halibut, and both were tasty. Our server was very nice, as was the chef who chatted up our 3 year old a bit. They even recommended half servings of fries since their servings were generous, and saved us a bit of $ by recommending their special based on what we ordered. Yum! :)"
2,The customer service is on point. The food was average. I wish the hours were more accommodating. I want to give this place another try but with the tight hours it's hard to visit again.
3,"I ordered the French Onion soup and a Chicken burger - the soup was mediocre, and kind of cold, but the burger was good(although the price makes it just kind of mediocre). Other times I have been here, the food has been average to above average quality, but overpriced. It is a good place however to sit and work during the day, when it's not too busy, since coffee refills are free."
2,Server forgot order. Had to wait while the rest of our party was eating. Once we got our order of wings they were raw. Our party's nachos were cold upon arrival. Food was not tasty. Overall a bad experience. Does not live up to the great ones name.
2,"I got there almost at 6:30 pm,, they gonna be close at7:00, but they were so unpainted and i didn't even had time to visit view all the cakes there, finally I ordered 2 pieces of cakes, but when I paid for it, they only packed one of them and forgot the other one , so"
2,"Well, that was a nice surprise. 

Visiting Toronto, needed to pick a restaurant for four people. Never heard of Weslodge but the menu looked good, so...

Greeted by the Maitre D', a charming Dubliner, dressed impeccably. Our waitress was so polished and professional. She knew her wine, presented it perfectly and was just wonderful. I saw her refold a patron's napkin, and put it in place when he left the tabletop a moment. 

Our second waitress, we had to move due to the noise from the bar area..it was Halloween and people were in costume and having fun...so our next waitress was as good as the first. And I appreciate not being called, 'you guys' by all the staff. 

The food was deliciously simple, well seasoned and fresh. The arugula salad was dressed so well. The half chicken was exceptionally good. The branzini was excellent, as was the chopped salad.

We will definitely go back there."
1,"Amazing food even after the management has changed.

I would absolutely recommend going for a brunch with friends or family.

They usually have great pris fix menus during city wide food events with summerlicious and winterlicious.

My personal favourite: French toast or the steak and frites. 

Can't decide!"
2,"Nice little gem in an unnoticed plaza in Scarborough (I missed turning in the first time). Parking is also very strange.. the parking lot is pretty empty and it might be because you need to pay?? so everyone basically just parked in the plaza literally right beside it then walked over. Owners and staff are super friendly, but considering the day I went (weekend for lunch) they might be a bit short handed with just 2 people on the floor. Food came at a decent pace but it was kinda hard to flag anyone down.

The restaurant has a lot of natural lighting thanks to the giant ceiling to floor windows. The restaurant also stretches to the back so theres more seating than it looks. The 2 people tables are jusstttt right for 2 people if you have 2 dishes in front of you, any more and you'll have stuff hanging off the sides.

Their salads are pretty good and refreshing; mangoes are fresh with just enough dressing so that its not too sour where a lot of places can get too excited on. You also get your choice of soup which is imo wonton soup. And of course, at any Thai restaurant the must try dish is the pad thai. I have to say the one here did not disappoint HOWEVER there was a tad too much garlic used and at times overpowered the flavours. A fave of mine to have at Thai restaurants is the thai iced tea - a bit too much ice here and kind of watered it down a bit; I would ask for less ice next time. Another dish I had was their curry; now the curry itself was great, but the rice was rather on the hard/dry side, even though it would be eaten with sauce.

All in all, a place with great and courteous service, and awesome deal food (in a somewhat weird plaza) ."
2,"If this place was on a high pedestrian traffic street, it would be packed all the time!! My most recent visit was a Saturday evening at around 7:30pm. There were two other couples dining in this modern spacious semi self-served joint. The two of us were greeted at the counter where the menu is above on the back wall. 

The Beijing sammy is awesome, but I love to browse around just to see what else is offered before making my final decision. As I did, I noticed they had a little sign saying they order their bread from St. John's Bakery (a little bakery around the corner from my house that does a LOT for the community). Immediately, I brought this up to the friendly lady behind the counter and started a little chat. Cheesewerks's rating just went up a star! They also sell goods to take home such as cheeses, cheese boards, jams etc.

After much debating and a little wine tasting (yep, wine), we finally ordered and sat at a table right BESIDE THE GAMES!! I was so excited to see them have board games such as Jenga, Monopoly, and Foodie Fight! We played as we waited for our food to be served:

The Beijing: (4/5 stars)
BBQ pork with hoisin and asiago cheese. A taste of familiarity of the Chinese char siu, which I love. Grilled with cheese (another love), there's nothing to complain about.

The Houston: (3/5 stars)
Braised beef brisket with jalapeno jack cheese, and house-made BBQ sauce, on sourdough. The beef, cheese, and even bread itself was good. However, I personally found the bbq sauce was a little bit too sweet for me. 

The LA Mac n Cheese: (3/5 stars)
Their mac n cheese was supposed to start featuring the following day, but i did not know and ordered it since it was already on the menu. The lady originally said it was only for the next day, but decided to make an exception to serve it to me. How nice! It came topped with avacado, arugula, and a citrus compote, which worked surprisingly well. It was good, but nothing spectacular that I haven't had before.

Cider and Wine: (4/5 stars)
YESS!! They have booze!! For a good price too!! They don't have an exhaustive list, but pretty decent and thorough.

Service: (5/5 stars)
Although its semi self-served, the lady was very friendly. 

**I usually list all the prices in my reviews, but I have no recollection of this time at all. But I DO remember that all this with booze, tax, and tip, came up to around forty-something bucks...

This place lacks a little bit in atmosphere. Again, the location hurts a little. Nonetheless, the service and food makes up for some of it. I really want to say I loved their grilled cheese, but after having grilled cheese from the NYC's grilled cheese truck (6/5 stars), this just does not compare. But I am NOT complaining about grilled cheese sandwiches, good service, board games, and beer! Definitely revisiting!"
1,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I am giving it a 4 star for the value and tastiness - a lunch time sit down 3 course meal for $15 and the food is indeed fresh and quite good. Not sure how \""healthy\"" it is as the mashed potatoes it came with were really buttery...and the pork chop was quite fatty and salty. But it sure did taste good!
I give it a 3 star for service. Although the service is friendly and the staff are extremely nice, the service was sloooooooooow. We were probably here for over 1.5 hours. There was 1 chef, 1 server and a second man helping out wherever he could. 
If you are in a rush or only have a 1 hour lunch, I wouldn't recommend coming here. If you have some time, and want a good meal for a great price, then definitely pop by!"
3,"Was OK, we were expecting something a lot better though. Had a mushroom dish, with lichen, was pretty good. But then came this cured beef dish which seemed like they just put a whole bunch of random toppings on it, like they were trying too hard. Wasn't a huge fan of it. And for a place that expensive, the restaurant interior was pretty meh, quite beat up and not impressive at all. Wouldn't return."
2,"One of the best places for BBQ in the big smoke (Toronto). 

Lawrence the Pit Master has it down to a science. From the baby back to the baked bean. You cannot go wrong. Just sit down have a drink and enjoy the BBQ."
1,"Just had our first visit to this restaurant. I had the bacon and egg breakfast and it was very good. It's a small nostalgic Like a New York diner that was reasonably priced for the portions you get.Staff were friendly , food was good and price was right. 
Will be back when in town again."
2,"This is my third trip to copper chimney and my first review. 

The restaurant is very pleasant. The restaurant is very clean and the staff very easy to deal with.

The menu has a lot of diversity to it and spans multiple foods from different parts of India.

Tonight I had the Methi Chicken and the eggplant.

The restaurant was able to provide multiple gluten free options to me.

The eggplant was divine. I did not expect it to be as flavourful as it was. It was loaded with the flavour of several black cardamom pods and was cooked half mashed and part chunks. It was really that good. I could've eaten two orders of this dish.

The methi chicken was loaded with fenugreek. I love having lots of fenugreek, and both dishes were topped with lots of fresh grated ginger which is another bonus as far as I am concerned.

I wanted to love this food more, but the chicken was white meat and was dried out, and a little heavy on the salt. This is a common practice that helps to cut down on prep time, but distracts away from the quality of an otherwise exceptional meal.

I would definitely eat at this restaurant again, but I'm hoping the meat will be juicier the next time I come."
1,"Great setting! Lobster cakes were lacking taste, but the salmon salad really made up for it. Huge piece of Salmon next to Asian themed salad with wasabi guacamole. Has great tables forsingle business traveler that stay at surrounding hotels. Also free wifi!"
2,"As a New Yorker spending much of his time in Toronto the last several years, I would call Bar Buca the best meal I have had in Canada. The entire experience was phenomenal and I would highly recommend. Some of my faves were the baby octopus, the beef heart, and any of the schiacciatas."
2,"Never coming back to this place. I love going to new coffee shops but this was such a disappointment. They have the rudest staff here. I forgot to tell the barista skimmed milk please as I was ordering and I requested it at the espresso bar. She scowled at me and said I already made it, meanwhile all she had done was steam the milk. The espresso hadn't been poured yet or anything. I apologized and she reluctantly steamed the skim milk. It wasn't like it was busy or anything, I was the only one ordering. Then she proceeded to throw the milk into my latte and toss my drink to me. She literally dumped the steamed milk into my cup, I've never seen a batista dump not even pour milk into a cup.Nothing special about the beans here, super light flavour and didn't taste any different from a latte from a generic coffee store."
2,"Clean,nice,friendly environment, not too many fancy options, simpleand easy and very economic"
2,"Love this place!Wonderful food , friendly atmosphere and attentive service. Went for the first time ten days ago with six people and have been back twice .We have tried the meatloaf (delicious and so moist and flavourful) the Ackee and salt cod (creamy codwith just right texture of rice and peas, oxtails , spaghetti bolognese (this dish was so good we went back to order it as takeout, the chicken,avocado and b.l.t. Sandwich which,with their fabulous fries was enough for two of us. It a very long time since I have been in such a comfortable atmosphere and served by such lovely people"
2,"This is a new low, my boyfriend just held my hair back so I can lick the take-out plate...... I love Grazie, the only problem is they are always busy, so you wait for 40 minutes for either a table or delivery."
1,Good place if you want something relatively quick and fairly cheap that's not standard fast food. I would suggest not getting takeout if you plan on ordering a sandwich like the Godfather (probably their best seller). The sauce they use (that's delicious) makes the ciabatta bun soggy by the time you get home. Worth checking out though it's a solid spot for sure.
3,"Essentially a rip off of Burger's Priest ('Holy' Chuck) with a more diverse menu. If you notice from behind the counter, they leave their balls of meat and bins of 'half cooked' bacon unrefrigerated to save cooking time. This is clearly a health code violation with regards to raw meat, and should not be overlooked. The typical Holy Chuck combo costs upwards of 20 dollars, a sloppy and disgustingly greasy barely 7 ounce burger with fries the size of toothpicks, up sold because of the sparse amount of herbs they put on them.All in all, Holy Chuck is an overpriced and lacklustre dining experience.Your time is better spent at the many other 'actual' upscale dining establishments in the Yonge and St. Clair area."
2,What a beautiful place to have dinner with the ladies. An upscale restaurany with food that definitely appeased the taste buds. The server was very helpful in answering any questions we had on the food choices. Plan to come back for their oyster night.
1,Had a shrimp chicken beef combo which includes rice and fried spring roll (which was a bit too greasy). Combo only had2 shrimp but for the price ($7) makes a decent quick lunch. Certainly not fine dining but good for lunch
2,"Y'know, I think I envisioned something different than what I actually found at Snakes and Lattes. I went with two friends on a Friday night and, as has already been mentioned, it was packed. And loud. And hotter than hot. The space is much more like a uni residence common room than I anticipated in that it's bright, barely comfortable, and lacking in character. However, the staff certainly know their games and were happy to offer help as required and they sell bottled beer (a plus, in case anyone's wondering). We had a great time playing our games and I'd go back again, but I'm not as completely in love as I hoped I might be."
1,"Very clean, and modern. Not your average mom and pop style shop. It's a big place, divided into two blocks of space.
 
 Took a look at the whole menu, prices are standard Vietname resto prices. Small pho is around $6.50, two appetizer rolls are $3.95. Very affordable. Also read that they deliver for free for orders over $25 (within 5km).
 
 I ordered Vermicelli with chicken for $7.50. It wasn't anything to knock my socks off (it's vermicelli, nothing you can really do to make it out-of-this-world), but it was tasty and fresh. Their portions are not so generous as some other places, but it was enough to fill me. I didn't come out feeling very full, but just right. Overall, a satisfying dinner was $10, including tax and generous tip.
 
 Unlike most privately-owned Vietnamese restaurants, place is very clean, spacious and modern, and service was great, while prices were only market price and food was good. A rare combination...I want to give five stars, but only after I try their pho! Will update :)"
3,"The pizza is pretty good. But their prices online and their actual prices are wildly different. That, or they purposely ripped us off.
 
 I would not return, just based on the lack of interest in it. They had no interest in fixing the prices, or giving us the prices from the website."
2,"This is a review for the restaurant Summerlicious 2017 dinner. After 3 for 3 successful Summerlicious 2017 outings, my 4th one was a total fail at Barnsteiner's. I guess my luck ran out.
 
 I heard a lot of wonderful things about this restaurant. The Chef and owner has worked for Jump and these are the same owners that were behind Corner House.
 
 I tried to organise a meetup event for a meetup group I run but there was no interest. Maybe I should have taken that as a sign. Since I still wanted to give a try, I organised a small dinner with my girlfriends for four.
 
 My friend was the first to arrive before me. The restaurant had led her to sit inside a hot stocky sunroom? with no AC and just a fan running to keep the air flowing. (It was hot that day). Had I been there first, I would not have accepted that table nor room. It was totally unbearable. thank goodness I could take some of my clothes to feel better and try to substain from the heat. There were still seats still available outside the patio and inside the air conditioned room. I don't quite understand why we were put in that room. Is it because I made a reservation on open table?
 
 Funny thing that there was a table for two, which they set next to our table and was put against a wall, resulting in a very uncomfortable position. Three times they try to sit people there and each time, the patrons asked to sit elsewhere as it was so stuffy.
 
 Then there is the food. Every dish I had that evening fell short and were inconsistent. Each plate of food came out looking very different even though some of us had ordered the same items. My main beef entree was just plain and it was missing a key veggie. My appetizer came out falling apart already before it was set on the table.My dessert had no sauce. When I inquired how come my dessert looked so completely different from my friend's, our waiter's explanation was because my friend's dessert had too much sauce?!? You would think the waiter would have noticed the inconsistency when bringing out all the dishes at once to our table but the waiter was pretty much rushing (even though the resto was not that busy). I felt the kitchen was just churning out dishes at a factory speed without giving a thought on taste and quality.
 
 Our waiter might have been consistent in taking orders and bringing out the dishes (maybe too fast which lead to my appetizer falling apart) but other than that.. that was it. He lacked charism and personality.
 
 I felt so bad for my girlfriends and I kept apologizing for such a disappointing dinner since I was the one who suggested this restaurant.They knew it wasn't my fault.
 
 I avoided another restaurant for years after a failed licious dinner and Barnsteiner's is no exception. This will be on my list to avoid for years to come."
1,"I love CJs because it is a quick and CHEAP lunch option, miso soup is free, and service is unbelievably friendly.
 
 However the sushi quality isn't amazing. Be picky about what you select. The basic sushi and vegetarian rolls are good, but avoid the ones made with smoked salmon and avoid the shrimp tempura dish - it's basically bread coated like a corn dog."
3,"Loved it!
 I would give them 5 stars but it is kind of pricey (for a student at least)"
3,"I grabbed my usual poke bowl today and the cashier was very nice. However the girl who usually prepares the food did not seem friendly, she seemed to be a new hire as she didnt give me the same portions I have recieved for the past 5+ times I have eaten here. I was very disappointed in the amount of food I was served for the price. I felt as if I was ripped off. Not quite sure if i will be coming back to this place again."
2,Stopped by Kelly's before the hockey game Monday night and had Laura M as a server. She recommended the fish tacos and scallops and both were amazing! I'll definitely be back!
3,"Given the excellent reviews from other Yelpers, we decided to go to Thai On Yonge for dinner last weekend to see what the fuss was about.

We walked in to find a number of patrons at the bar who had obviously been drinking for quite a while. As we sat at our table, a few of these patrons paced back and forwards between the bar and the window overlooking Yonge Street for some reason, which made for a very awkward dining experience.

My friend and I both ordered Khao Soi and we shared the spring rolls. The rolls were pretty good, but the Khao Soi lacked flavour and the sauce was not hot enough. Definitely not the quality and freshness I expected from a $30 meal for two.

The service was fast and the waitress was very friendly, Overall three stars, not helped by the \""interesting\"" clientele."
2,"Ordered through SkipTheDishes. My order didn't take long to arrive. I ordered the Halibut and chips, but the fish was overcooked and dry. It's definitely fish but it's dry to the point that it's almost the texture of chicken. Also, did not receive any cutlery or condiments, don't even ketcup for my fries.  Will not be ordering from here again."
1,"Came here on a Wednesday night at around 9pm. The cafe was 80% full. My friends and I came here with the intention of playing board games. I can't remember if you have to get a drink or if there is no minimum if you stay on a weekday (Mon-Thurs). If you stay on Fri-Sun, you have to spend a minimum of $10 every 3 hours to stay. That sounds fair to me...they're trying to make profit on their busiest days. And instead of paying the sitting fee, you can use that money towards food or drink. 

They have a good variety of board games, the games are labeled with stickers based on the level of difficulty, two players game and/or party game. We played four of their games and they are in good condition with all the games pieces intact. 

I ordered the roasted milk tea with grass jelly. I tried my friend's drink with tapioca. The tapioca tastes better than grass jelly. 
I would say my drink taste average - there are other bubble tea places around the plaza that tastes better, as well as bubble tea places that tastes worse. 
I would come back to play board games and will give their drink another shot."
2,"We had a terrible experience today at lunch. The white napkins all were stained, one water glass had a full dried lipstick mark, and there was a a lot of hair on the smoked salmon. 
We should have left and we regret not doing so. We did not receive an apology or proper discount. 
We work in the area and enjoy going out for lunch but we will never return here!"
2,pretty good late night spot...i came here pretty late on a sunday.ordered steak tarter and a couple drinks..good music great vibe !!!
1,"Best sushi for the best price in Toronto with very good service. Everything is always fresh, pearl sushi is number 1 !!!!"
3,"This place absolutely had the chewiest hard wings I've ever eaten. It's criminal considering the outrageously high prices they charge not to mention my gf ordered a Pina colada with a double shot and it clearly wasn't although to her credit the bartender added another shot to make it up to her. 
Guess I'm still looking for a great wing place as this clearly isn't it. The atmosphere and place itself is nice if you don't care about the quality of the food though. 
Also in a side note don't bother with the blue cheese dip as it is tasteless !"
2,"A friend introduced me to Poke Guys and I have gone 3 days in a row now.  Tried the PG, Cali and A Hui Hou Signature Bowls...  all are great, very fresh and delish!!  Staff are very friendly.  Good amount of seating.  There may be a line up depending what time you are there."
2,"Super excited to have this location open close to home. I've frequented the Cityview location often and was happy to not have to drive so far.

So, we'll start with the good
Portions are still big
Area is spacious and clean
Manager is a very welcoming, and friendly gentleman.
The wrap is still good.

The bad
The plates at this location are just bad. It's a \""big\"" portion that is 40% salad, 50% rice, and 10% meat. They also charge extra for hummus on the side of your plate (but you get it for free on wrap????). So if you spend less, and buy a wrap, you get the hummus for free. But if you spend more money and buy a plate, you have to pay extra for a dismal amount of hummus.
The sauce provided with the plate comes in a small portion not suited for half the plate. They call the white sauce garlic (toum) but it's a watered down tzatiki. They're hot sauce is literally ketchup with pepper seeds in it, it was actually disgusting.
There's one middle aged woman who prepares food that just has the most sour attitude. Did not want her to make my food at all.
The wrap is not consistent. While I appreciate the fresh pita made, this leads to the pita not always being rolled properly. Sometimes the pitas are too big, and when wrapped you'll have areas where there is just thick pita in your shawarma.

I've left a 2 star review for this location because I personally, will not be coming back here. If you decide to visit this location, do not spend more money opting for the plate. Go for the wrap. Although I'd recommend Euro shawarma down the street. for a less expensive, better food experience."
2,"A consistently delicious, authentic Mexican cantina-style place with a Dundas East kind of shabbiness to it. These guys do it right."
2,"I was disappointed. I was looking forward to a luxury version of the banh mi's I'm accustomed to in Chinatown. However, I got a lackluster toasted bun, hardly any cilanto, no interesting veggie toppings, and fried pork with a strong spice aftertaste. The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird: you can't see your sandwich being assembled on account of a 5 foot tall wall."
3,"The porchetta focaccia sandwich was absolutely phenomenal. Very tender roast pork with an extremely flavorful sauce that really went well together. The focaccia bread was toasted a little too crisp (almost like a bruchetta), but I still enjoyed it very much. 

The crudo arctic char was also really delicious. Like a sashimi, the char tasted very fresh. Didn't taste the squid ink salt though. Again, the bread that came with it was overly crisp and too hard for my liking.

The merluzzo black cod was very tender, but felt it could have used a little more flavor. The portion was also very small, so didn't think it was worth the price. 

The arrosticini ewe meat skewer wasn't that special. Tasted like a regular kafta skewer, and didn't notice any special texture or flavor of the meat. Two tiny skewers for $10, wasn't worth it. 

The coniglio alla milanese rabbit loin was a disappointment. Didn't expect it to be deep fried! The meat was very thin and didn't taste like rabbit. Still tasty, but was like eating a veal schnitzel with an egg. 

The polpette di capra goat and ricotta meatballs was quite nice. But my meatball was still cold inside and had to send it back. Server gave us a brand new dish, but had to wait quite a while for it to be re-cooked.

The porchetta, crudo, and polpette di capra was definitely worth trying, the others, I would pass on if I had to order again. 

The wait to get our table was quite long and we had to share our table with another group. Too loud to have a conversation without yelling so the dining atmosphere wasn't that great. 

Our server was very attentive and professional. The chefs however could use a little more training and professionalism. Serving cold meatballs is inexcusable, they should know when the food is properly cooked. Also, on numerous occasions, I saw them wiping their nose while preparing the food bare handed. Another chef was eating some of the food while plating the dishes. This type of behavior should not be happening, especially with an open concept kitchen where the customers can see their every move. Sometimes it's better to just not know what happens in the kitchen... 

Although I really enjoyed a couple of the dishes, given the long wait time, loud and uncomfortable seating, and unprofessional chefs, it will likely be a while before I decide to come back and give this restaurant a second try."
2,"As part of a hodgepodge potluck/tour with my friends to sample as many vendors' offerings as possible, I bought the gnocchi. This gnocchi is crack. One bite apiece, and two of my friends were compelled to get their own portions.

Freshly put together in front of my eyes, this beautiful white sauce gnocchi is extremely crave-worthy. Rich and decadent, perfect size and chew/texture on the gnocchi, and addictively fragrant, the mushroom truffle gnocchi was an extremely delectable bowl of comfort.

It's definitely on my list for when I return to Assembly Chef's Hall for round 2, with sights set on the red sauce variant and the burger. My only regret is buying only a half portion. Recommended."
2,"Sweet!? The Gelato maybe a little too sweet for my taste? All I remember was sweetness, maybe it is a good thing?!

I do love the set up of this cafe and of course the awesome Yelp Check In offers for the free upgrade!

Staff is nice and patience as my friend just could not decide on what flavours she likes and after a few I kind of phased out.....

I will be back again when I am in the area and give this G For Gelato a try! And I will find a flavour I will like!"
2,"Jack Astors, the one on Dundas has a great view from roof top, the service was good and consistent on all the locations, they have a great collection of beers on tap and bottles... the poutine was great, didnt get a chance to try other stuff though..."
2,People who complain about this place just don't have enough money to enjoy it.  Everyone wants everything for nothing.  Some girl below even complained about the quality of her welfarelicious meal...just save up and shut up.
2,"best peameal bacon and biscuit I've ever had...the bacon donut was also amazing, as was the coffee.  Wife had the French toast, and it was great, but not amazing.  5 stars!"
2,"Decided to walk in here to grab a quick bite and expected something on par with St. Louis given the humble sports decor. I ordered the 3rd degree hot flavour based on the server's recommendation and I was pleasantly surprised to find the wings here are pretty solid. You can get them double dusted with a wide selection of sauces and dry rubs. Everyone I was with ate wings so we didn't try anything else, but we all enjoyed them. I'm pretty sure these are the best wings in the Yonge and Eglinton area and are well worth your time if your looking for a tasty meal."
2,"Very friendly owner. Good food, clean place and big portion (we ordered the mixed plate for 2)"
1,"As far as food court meals go in the PATH, this is about as good as it gets.....hence the extra star.  Not cheap but certainly not expensive by any stretch.  The large burrito is far more than I can eat in one sitting. I was prepared to be very disappointed after reading the reviews here BUT.....surprise, surprise my burrito was quite decent.  I don't care for rice in my burrito and that wasn't a problem.  The guacamole was very good, vegetables were better than average, I like the whole wheat tortilla option, etc.  This is by far the best \""food court\"" meal I've had in the Commerce Court.  I no longer feel the need go to Burrito Boyz, which has gone downhill BTW.  You can find places that will make a better burrito....but not in the PATH."
2,"Located across from Honest Eds on Bloor Street, this new Ka Chi location was very easy to find. Had to wait 2 hours for Snakes and Lattes... we might as well go eat first :)

First impression of Ka Chi was WOW, this Korean restaurant had a serious upgrade! Never seen a Korean restaurant this trendy before, EVER! The high ceiling, dark decor and furniture looked very chic and modern :) It definitely brings in a younger crowd with pop and jazzy music blasting in the background.

Both my friend and I ordered the beef bimbimbap served in a hot stone bowl. Watch out because it is REALLY hot. It is even more delicious if you add their Korean hot and sour sauce to it... not too too spicy #yum! You also get the typical complimentary small appetizers too.. with kimchi, spicy cucumber, seaweed, bean sprouts, japchae noodles, etc.

Overall, a very satisfying meal indeed (very stuffed!). Service was great - courteous and quick... responded well to our special requests! Restaurant itself and washroom downstairs were kept clean. So, congratulations, 4/5 stars! I really enjoyed eating here... and it is a good place to catch up with friends :) I will definitely come back to try out more of their menu items!"
3,"I really like Neapolitan pizza. It is a huge thing back in DC and it is my first choice for sure. I came here with a group and was the martyr in the ordering process. The salad with the egg was probably the highlight. The menu was actually pretty small, but everything we had was really good. If I lived near here I would probably eat here somewhat frequently, though it is still kind of expensive for pizza, but it isn't so great that I would make the trip across town to end up here. A solid offering though."
1,"If you want all you can eat Japanese food, this is the place to go.  You are given a menu and then you are supposed to write what you would like on an order sheet.  Everytime we bring guests to this restaurant, they are shocked by how many items are available.  Lunch on weekend is $13.99 which is a great deal compared to other restaurants.  The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service can be less than desirable.  The servers could smile once in a while.  At least the manager is really nice to us so I'll still keep coming back."
2,"This place wows!  We've tried almost everything on the menu, pork belly and black cod are standout stars, but nothing really disappoints.  The app sashimi dish is surprisingly substantial in size, not to mention its freshness and quality cut. 

Secure a reservation or you may end up waiting especially on weekends. Definitely worth it!"
1,"Expectations for food court restaurants are usually pretty low, and often times for good reason. The food has been sitting around for too long and isn't fresh and the prices for what you get are often a bit out of whack.

This is not the case however at Thai Bright. Located in the food court of Village By The Grange, this always busy food counter offers up fresh and tasty Thai and Pan Asian cuisine at very reasonable prices. For starters, at lunch which is their busiest time, they offer a special for noodles or rice plus one meat plus veggies for $5. That's amongst the best deals you can get for lunch in the downtown area. If you prefer to go for something off the buffet style food available, the Pad Thai or Pad Sew are both tasty and generous in quantity, and are made to order for under $9. Drinks are pretty standard prices, appetizers are as well. If you ask, they offer samples for you to try and see what you'd like (at least in my experiences).

The staff has remained the same during the entire time it has been open and are very friendly and professional, no mater how busy they are. They also have good memories as they remembered what My regular order was after only a few visits. 

Lunch done quick and right for $5. Definitely worth the trip!"
2,I love the idea of this place. Everything is made in house! I had the Killer Chicken Burger and hubby had the Ace High Club Sandwich. Both were delicious. I found the Killer Chicken a bit salty to my taste but hubby says that's because of the bacon which was sharp. An acquired taste I'm told. Anyway our server Nat was very friendly and efficient. The decor is nice too. Casual but classy. The bathrooms looked like they need another coat of paint. They don't quite match the cool look of the rest of the place. But that's a small thing to nit pick about. My pet peeve about bathrooms is that they're either freezing cold or boiling hot. This one was just right. I would definitely come back here to try other dishes.
2,"Good restaurant, Food is made from quality ingredients and served with a friendly smile!"
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE! Will be back for sure. After doing an elimination diet and having a new found appreciation for companies that cater to people who can't eat stuff, I decided to try this place.

It was sooooooooo good.

I ordered the vegan mozarella, mushroom and tomato buckwheat crepe. I want to eat another. Of course it is a savoury crepe, but they drizzled maple syrup on it, and it was to die for. The texture and taste of the crepe was perfect and there was so much non-soy vegan cheese inside it, they were very generous with it. 

I don't know why I didn't order desert, that was a bad mistake.

The staff there were very nice too. One of the cooks (the owner maybe?) saw that I was waiting in line to order, so he came by and suggested some of his favourite dishes. I already knew what I wanted though, so I ordered it. I waited at a table by the window and enjoyed people watching Kensington market people. Then when my crepe arrived I downed it. I personally really like health conscious restaurants because I do think they are more creative and they really pay attention to quality and taste. The price was about $10 for a delicious lunch. Can't wait to eat there again. Oh yes, I eat meat and eggs too and yet I was satisfied :D"
2,"Super Retro looking diner (think Back to the Future 1950s) in the heart of Yorkdale. You even have to take a swanky elevator to get there.

Fairly busy on a Sunday Morning for brunch but we didn't have to wait for a table.  I got the giant breakfast with eggs, sausage, back bacon and regular bacon ($15) and my girlfriend got the eggs benny with peameal. Everything came quickly. The only catch was the eggs Benny were cold and sadly we had to send it back. It was returned no problem and they made a new one, only problem was it was with ham instead of peameal. 

Overall the service and ambiance was good but the food was a bit lacklustre."
1,"Best cheap pizza I've ever had, only peperoni slices but that's all they need 3.25 for a slice and it's perfect"
3,"I had my birthday party last Saturday with about 50 guests for dinner.  Even though the venue is nice, I would not recommend this place for a large party.  I've written about the food and experience below:

I have to say the food portions were quite disappointing, I expected the portions to be larger considering the premium prices for the platters.  The flatbread/tacos seemed like they were served on tiny little chips with toppings dumped on top.  The frite cones especially were quite surprising - there were about 4-7 fries in each cone if even that for each guest.  I didn't want that to ruin my night, so I just went with it - my boyfriend and I even skipped our meals so there would be more for my guests.  I found out the next day that half my guests went to another restaurant for dinner after my dinner because they were still hungry.

Aside from the food, the service was okay (automatic gratuity charge). I wish the serving of the food was more organized, I later found out one table was missing a flatbread platter so I'm assuming it went to another table.  Considering there were only 5 tables to serve amongst 3 waiters, I don't see why it wasn't kept track amongst themselves.  In addition, one of my guests was rejected to order food/drinks at the table because he wanted to pay cash.  He then went to the bar to grab drinks for a few of us, the waitress came up to me and said to order from her instead of going to the bar so she can, I quote \""make some money too\"".  I thought that was quite unprofessional but then told my guest to try to order at the table after this round of drinks.  He then told me how he was rejected to order at all because he was paying cash.  I know it may be easier for them to keep track with a credit card or whatever the system may be.  But I did not expect this kind of service at the Beer Hall.  I think after this experience, it's safe to say I most likely will not host another party here myself."
2,Nicely decorated and comfortable seating.  Servers very friendly and knowledgeable! Really like their wine selection - common favourites that you would recognize.  Meals were tasty and well prepared.
2,"Great tasting Katsu, the taro ice cream and chips are delicious.  Very very friendly staff, have been back multiple times and the customer service is always friendly."
2,Got the Pad Thai to go because it was a packed house with a hour wait on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't to die for but I blame part of it on the fact that I got it to go. Definitely going to try eating in when I get the chance.
2,"This is a bit of a trek for me being in Roncy, but it's worth it for comfy, hearty Polish food. 

Inside has the look of a homestyle, country restaurant definitely not fancy but a neighborhood restaurant. 

Service is quick and attentive and there's plenty of the good stuff on the menu to choose from. Their soups are awesome here, I've had the mushroom and dill and the borsht with dumplings-both hit the spot on a cold night! Their perogies can't be beat, they are soft, pillowy treasures-my favorites being the sauerkraut (sp?) and the cheese. 

They have specials each night which come with salad and soup-quite the deal and their portions are ample here."
2,"I was never raised to have brunch but sure I was raised to have western style breakfast. I happened to always wake up and to eat around brunch time at home, and I also love the combination of sweet and salty in my meal.

This is the first time I actually woke up on time to go out for brunch at an restaurant. I didn't give 5 stars because the wait for the line and for the food was way too long. Half an hour waited on the line and half an hour wait after we ordered the food.

I ordered a chocolate-strawberry malt milkshake, it was good, not amazing.
My favorite was the Chicken waffle and Blueberry buttermilk pancakes. The salt and the syrup fuses together.

We also ordered the omelet, not really a fan of omelet, to me its just eggs with some other ingredients stays inside a pan fry egg, instead of eggs with other ingredients which creates a new taste."
2,"Beware, the coffee here is so good, it will ruin coffee everywhere else.

Hands-down, the best coffee I've had in the city.  The staff have always been great -- maybe not super-friendly but real pros.  Have a glass of cucumber water while you are waiting for your coffee.  Great foam art.

I'm a latte person, I don't enjoy espresso outside of Italy, but here I go with the cappuccino so I can better taste the coffee.

No internet although people still compute here.  Bit of a counter-cultural vibe but not in your face and the music isn't too loud.  Good mix of customers.

I haven't tried Sam James, maybe it's just as good, but the coffee (or capp) Manic is much better than Te Aro, Dark Horse, Mercury, Jet Fuel, Green Beanery, or any of the other places that I've tried."
2,"Mike is everything you expect for a modern Japanese establishment.  Modern furniture, loud music and young and hip crowd.  Personally, I like the more traditional vibe of the likes like Shoushin or Kaji or Zen.

My wife and I had the Aburi Kaiseki.  We loved the plates they use and overall the presentation was a modern take on how sushi would be plated.  The flavours overall were very good and they focus more on complex flavours instead of the simple defining taste where the fish is the star of the show (think Yasu).

My only real gripe with this place is that the pace of the kaiseki is incredibly slow."
2,"Did a take out order of a pulled pork sandwich with beans and coleslaw for the hubby, and fried chicken dinner for me.

Hubby said the pulled pork sauce was tangy but a bit too sweet.  The pork was chewy and not smokey at all.  He had a sandwich from Phil's Original BBQ at the same time and liked it much better.  He also likes the coleslaw and beans at Phil's better.

The fried chicken crust tasted burnt and way too salty, but the chicken inside was moist and flavourful... but I eat fried chicken for the crunchy crust, so this was a fail.

The biscuit that came with the fried chicken tasted terrible, and I threw it out.

Hubby wants to go back for brunch to try the Remedy that he has heard so much about, but I doubt that I will join him."
2,"Big fan of the Gabby's chain of pubs, at least the half dozen or so I've visited over the years. The Danforth location is close to the Missus' place so we've had a chance to stop by 3-4 times.

Service: the staff have been fantastic each and every time. On the last visit, the Missus wasn't feeling 100% so our server brought out a drink that she likes when she's feeling under the weather. Nice touch.

Food: the fajitas are great, especially on Texmex Tuesdays where they're 30% off. Had the Danforth Burger myself last visit. I wanted it to be THE item I'd order there every time, but it won't be. Salty, over cooked, nothing special.

Atmosphere: love the set up of the place, TVs everywhere, big enough bar to accommodate a few, great regulars and a few booths for privacy. Don't care for the constant opening of the patio doors for smokers in winter but will just have to sit on the other side next visit.

Other stuff: NTN, Megatouch, ATM but no WiFi"
2,One of the best restaurants for burgers in my opinion. I'm really not a fan of the fries nonetheless still 5 stars !
3,"There's just something so disheartening about aggressively mediocre food. It's not bad enough to really get upset, nor is it good enough to provoke any real enthusiasm. It's just...there.

Habiba provides just such an experience.

I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap, which comes adorned with all the usual toppings one expects from such a concoction. I asked for mine without pickled turnips and with extra hot sauce.

After preparing the wrap, the cook placed it in a panini press and left it in there for about 30 seconds. This move left me scratching my head, since that amount of time isn't even remotely enough to make any difference.

The wrap itself is fine. Some of the chicken pieces were vaguely crispy, and the sauces and toppings were good (if completely lazy and uninspired). But the whole thing just felt sloppily assembled, with the lack of cohesion resulting in a wrap that was different from bite to bite (i.e. some contained just chicken, while others tasted only of lettuce and tomato).

There are ultimately too many superior options for similar fare in this area for me to consider going back to Habiba."
2,"Came here around 5:30 on a Sunday for an early dinner. Not that busy. I ordered tofu seafood soup while my boyfriend got the pork bone soup. Side dishes were alright, nothing special. The soup was hot but the broth for both of our meals was very salty. My tofu soup did not have that much in it, only some squid and minimal tofu. The bill came to $20 plus tip. Pretty average pricing and average food. The servers didn't come to fill our side dishes or tea on their own. But they were quick once we called them over. Overall, the experience was average but,  there are so many korean restaurants in Chinatown. This one can be skipped"
2,"Favourite bakery in Toronto.

The servers are almost invariably unsmiling and somewhat brusque, but it doesn't matter because everything found here tastes wonderful. Prices are steep but I believe this is because they use butter, cream, chocolate, nuts, etc. generously-- at least this is what the taste and undeniable quality of the ingredients suggests.

Best bets:

Cheese blintzes: to die for. buttery, very tender blintz, with sweet, light, creamy cheese filling that has the milky-sweat cream taste of ricotta as well as the faint tang of mascarpone/cream cheese. These are proof positive that God wanted us fat.

- empanadas: (moist, well seasoned, consitently delicious, buttery pastry. I do not wish to know how much fat is in a vegetable number here, as I enjoy pretending they are healthy AND delicious).
- chocolate pistachio cookies: wherever the country of origin for these is, I want to live. Now.
- cinnamon rolls: limited quantity, as with much of their amazing inventory. they are just sweet enough, with no icing, but a super soft, impossibly pillowy texture.
- bagels: do not need butter. are insane. I want one now.
- seed loaf: puts Cobb's to shame. expensive though. omega three's aren't cheap.

I could go on, but won't. Suggest immediate patronage."
1,"Food was pretty good, I had the pad thai. Tasted very authentic and price was right, especially if you're a student. Not very fond of the service. Would only come back for the price and the convenience."
2,"Great lattes with doodles of leaves and hearts in the foam... yummy .. $4 each but give a $5 the barista deserves a tip too...

2,"This place probably wins for most instagrammable cafe in Toronto. We ordered a strawberry waffle, fruit chamomile tea, and the earl grey rose latte. Overall I had a pretty good experience, the food looks better than it tastes."
2,"Perfectly flavourful, fresh and delicious Indian cuisine with warm and friendly service = an A+ experience! Modern, bright and welcoming atmosphere if you want to dine in. This is the only place I go for spicy-good Indian food. You don't even miss the meat because each vegetarian or vegan dish is cooked to perfection and bursting with delightful flavour! Must-try: Channa Masala, Dal Makhni, Aloo Gobi and Roti. The Indian dessert (forget the name) was absolutely divine!"
2,"Wanted to try this through skip the dishes and was extremely disappointed. I ordered the charcuterie board and they gave me a box just lined with meat with a couple of green vegetables, beets and pickles. There was no Dijon as advertised nor any bread. I feel ripped off as I paid full price for the meal and will not be ordering from here again."
1,"Had cod and halibut fish and chips. Was satisfied with both but I've tried a few better places in the city for fish and chips.

The potions and price were good. The fish was decent no complaints but again nothing special.

The fries were really good, although they were a bit too salty. 

This place is small with not much seating so you might be forced to get take-out if it gets really busy."
2,"Good food, good music. Really loud and busy on a Friday night, but to be expected.  Staff was decent but not very attentive. Decent beer selection. The menu is ok but nothing great. Good place to go with some friends but wouldn't recommend it for a date night."
1,"I've had the pleasure of dining here a couple times and it's always a great time. The staff are extremely nice and the food is amazing! Every time I go I get the all-you-can-eat deal for $25 where you can get Sushi and Dim Sum and order as much as your heart desires. One thing you should keep in mind when you dine with them, the food portions are big. Not small and annoying like most 'all you can eat' places. What you see in the pictures advertised is what you'll get."
2,Loved my experience at Pearl Diver!!! If you go you have to order the oysters and clam chowder. I also got the Coconut Mussels and the Hazelnut Trio for dessert. Super delicious
2,"Terrible service. The waiter brought out the wrong order and we still had to pay for it. 

Food was cold - Cheese on nachos should be gooey not rock hard. 

Probably my worst customer service experience ever. 

Would only recommend for drinks.... if even that."
2,"I love this place. This is my second time going and it was even better than the first.

I ordered a foot long Big Texan (beef) with: jalapeno monterey jack cheese, the usual sauteed peppers/onions, sauce (philthy sauce, horsey sauce and either southwest chipotle or ancho chipotle... whichever one looked creamy....I can't remember)

Went with a group of people so I was able to try the perogies poutine and I have to say that I found the combination a little weird. The gravy with the sour cream...those flavours just did not mesh well in my opinion. Overall I was underwhelmed by the fries. 

The staff was friendly and the seating area was  clean.

I would recommend this place for the sandwiches."
2,"I hadn't heard if this place before and stopped in for the first time after being recommended by a friend.
Place was nice, menu was simple offering something for everyone.

Ordered buffalo shrimp to share with my friend and loved it. The buffalo flavor was perfect and didn't over power the shrimp.

Lobster taco was good. Not great. The lobster seemed to get lost in all the flavors. 

Highlight: Maritime roll. Amazing. Huge chunks of warm lobster with butter and a perfect amount if mayo nestled in a fresh bun. Fries were fresh cut and cooked perfectly. 

Disappointment: service. Server was gonna take our food order before taking r drink order. She confused 2/3rds of r order but was quick to correct it. 

Will definately b back and would love to try  the Ossington location."
2,"I've been dying to try this spot out and finally got the chance Friday night. I will certainly be back.

We ordered the 1/2 ribs, pulled pork, with fries, cole slaw and onion rings as sides. 
We both ordered beer recommended by our server and we both really enjoyed it, though I can'f  for the life of me remember the name.

Our food came quickly and our server was cheerful and attentive. My fave hands down were the ribs. Made just the way I like them, a charred crispyness, not at all fatty - you have to work to get it off the bone, and oh, so tasty.  I preferred mine with the dry rub only. It had a subtle apple flavour. The sauce was good, but I was happy to leave it on the side where I found it.  

Onion rings were delicate and delicious. Fries felt like they needed a little something, but we ate them all without complaint. My date loved the cole slaw and the pulled pork, but I was all about the ribs.

Music fluctuated between really loud and a conversational volume. Not sure what was going on there, but I prefer not to yell over dinner. 

Can't wait to go back!"
2,"Delicious crepes.   

An amazing collection of art schoolers and ESL students tapping away at the free wi-fi.  Gorgeous serving staff.   Excellent haircuts.  Delicious crepes.

All the shiny shiny of being in the middle of a small gallery across from a very big gallery with none of the horrible pretension or lost puppy.  

Delicious crepes."
2,"The matcha crepe cake is delicious, drinks are too sweet, we ordered 80% sugar, still too sweet. Gonna try 50% next time."
3,"Pretty decent for a chain restaurant.  For starters we ordered the charity bread and calamari.  The bread came in a small square cast iron pan the portion was ok for sharing between 2-3 people.  There was a nice garlicky flavor to it although it was very very oily.  Our calamari portion was tiny given the price and the pieces were cut very small..flavor was ok but by the time it reached our table it was just about cold--I probably would not order it again it's just not good value.  

Our mains were one each of the Butcher and Diavolo pizzas and a lobster spaghetti.  The pizzas were a reasonable size and were well prepared.  The balsamic drizzle on the Diavolo really gave the chicken a nice zing.  For us the standout of the meal was the lobster spaghetti.  The dish contained decent sized pieces of lobster meat and the Rose sauce was balanced--not too tart or sweet.  Pasta was cooked al dente. Service was excellent. Our server was very busy but managed to provide good service."
1,"Good Korean restaurant with a HUGE menu. You want K barbeque? They do it. You want soup? They got lots! Stone bowls? Bim bam bap, katsu dinners, black bean noodles? dumplings? They have it! They also do purple rice with the set menus. 

Some menu items seem high in prices - but then they do offer a lot of combo meals that I think are quite reasonable. What I like most is that they have combo meals. My go to is The black bean noodles paired with dumplings. I think it's about $10. I always have leftovers. 
I've also had the tofu soup and it's tasty and good amount of spice. 

They have the free apetitizers at the beginning of the meal - an assortment of mostly cold apps, such as kimchi, bean sprouts, noodles and others. You can ask for refills if you desire. 

 Everyone is super friendly - Always a cheerful greeting when you enter. Nice and cozy and they have the TV set to Korean programming as well. 

Parking can be dodgy at times, it really depends on what time you go, since there is a seafood/banquet Chinese restaurant a couple of spaces down and a small plaza with other eateries and small shops/offices in the plaza."
2,"Oh, Korean Fried Chicken. How I love thee. Cheers, Chicken and Beers is just making that love stronger. A small venue with about 12 tables, you WILL have to wait; this place is busy! They don't take reservations for more than 10, so make sure only those with true love for KFC join your party. There is a municipal parking lot next door and free parking on side streets and plaza across the street. 

We ordered 4 whole chickens, 1 of each sauce. Each chicken comes with a healthy portion of fries and some fried rice cakes disguised as fries in the mix. We tried Original($24.95), Sweet, Soy and Spicy($25.95). They are served in pieces in a basket with the fries and the whole lot is tossed it the chosen sauce. LOVE IT!  Only downside is that the fries get soggy after awhile.  What's impressive,  is that there was almost no grease to speak of. For how much fried chicken I've eaten, this brings it to a whole other level. 

When you think Original, don't think plain; these are far from plain. They were dusted with parmesan cheese and scallions. The fries had the parmesan baked in and they weren't salty. Wow, just Wow. The sweet sauce was alright, not a front runner. The spicy sauce made my face hurt. I know, I know, I'm not good at spice, but I definitely drank all of the water on the table and finished my beer. If you like spicy, this is for you! The crowd favourite was Soy. The combo of sweet and salty made this disappear fast.  

The service had a bit of a rocky start, but smoothed out by the time the food came. Like I said, this place is busy! They don't split bills, but as a large group, we're used to it and were prepared.  

Left with a fully belly: mission accomplished."
3,"Super yummy amazing burgers, a big favourite with the whole family. Have gluten free options and do their best to make sure of no cross contamination - yay! Would be five stars but pretty pricey - we don't order from here too often because of that, tend to keep it as a very special treat."
1,"I would recommend this place if you fall into one of these two groups:

1. You are a 20-something wanting to have a beer with friends and eat some relatively affordable junk food.

Or

2. You're parents of a toddler and desperately want to remember what it feels like to go out to a restaurant but, for whatever reason, don't want to use a babysitter and thus bring your little person/people along.

I fall into the latter category. The food was average to poor but what redeems this place (and thus the 3- and not 2-star rating is the fact they were so amenable to having a toddler weave between the servers all night.

I didn't have any expectations so I was neither impressed not disappointed."
2,"Of the many scattered pho temples in Toronto, this is by far the best one. The first thing you'll notice upon being seated is the color of the walls,  an unusual off tint Pepto bismol pink. It is of no importance, as the soup is what you made the trip for. For starters, The broth is something born from near perfection. Clear and flavorful, with just the right mix of ginger, oil and spices, it is worth five minutes to savor on it's own. Next are the noodles. A smooth and velvety consistency, at first seeming like they may be a bit on the overdone side but they be very stray from that perfectly done consistency. And finally, the beef. The only ingredient of somewhat less preferential quality, it is nonetheless still very good. It's not outstanding, but it's very good. The spring rolls are unusual in their appearance but are tasty, the veggie version is best. Try the mango shakes as well as the broken rice. Gets compared to the pho place up the street a lot, but this is the true King of pho on Ossington. There are no substitutes."
2,While on vacation we decided to check out Duke's around happy hour. This was a great choice. Our server did an amazing job making suggestions and letting us  know what the local favorites are. We really enjoyed the sweet potato thing! The sauce that accompanied this appetizer was very good !  The next time I am in Toronto I will make a stop here !!
3,"I was sooooooooooo excited to try tkre.  I think I set my expectations too high. I stalked them on instagram, I'd salivate every time I passed their \""butter chicken paneer\""  sign. Let's face it,  butter and chicken are some of my hot words.
When I came in here on pride weekend with my sister, we ordered a beer, a pop, and two butter chicken paneers. Points for selling beer. Points off for a bug being in my beer. For 2 wraps and two beverages, the total came to  $32 and change. WTH, not worth it!
We asked for something non spicy for my sister because she's a baby and they suggested the butter chicken. 
It was too spicy for her.
I ended up eating both.
They tasted bland to me.
I REALLY wanted to love this place, but I just didn't."
2,"Went here for the first time for their winterlicious menu and loved the atmosphere of this restaurant right away! The food was amazing, especially their famous french onion soup which is a must-try! Only let down was the melted pear sorbet for dessert, tasted amazing but was just quite melted when the server brought it out. Other than that, would definitely recommend and go back to try the rest of their menu."
1,"Randomly stopped in here on our walk around Chinatown for some Dim Sum, without any prior knowledge of the area or other offerings, and our group was pleasantly surprised! 

Food: There were a ton of options, but we settled on sweet and sour pork, house fried noodles, fried rice, a few spring rolls, and three servings of Xiaolongbao. All of it was quite tasty and was the perfect amount for six people (per the server's recommendation.) I will say the fried rice was some of the best I have had and my friend (who has spent ~6 mos in China) claims that the Xiaolongbao was better than any he had over there.

Service: While a little hard to figure out what was going on at times (normal confusion in a busy Chinese restaurant) the server was very attentive, and offered up some good suggestions for all of us.

Additional Thoughts: If you find yourself wandering around Chinatown looking for a casual lunch spot, this is a great choice. The price is very affordable (our whole group was less than $70 CAD) and it was a fun time before we hit Kensington Market."
3,"this place is insanely expensive and very very busy, but the decor is beautiful, as are the views, and the food is fantastic. this is the place to take your wealthy family members who want to \""do brunch\""-- they have great dim sum and the waitstaff is very attentive. i'd venture to say they have the best dumplings in toronto. 

that being said, i would never come here alone because of money constraints. an entree costs $20-$40 and a plate of six dumplings is about $10."
2,"We used to like Sushi on Roncy but now that is under new management we REALLY like it! The new owners are lovely and very appreciative of return customers! The food is even better and they now have some Korean options too, which is kind of nice since there are no Korean restaurants anywhere near here. Solidly good sushi. Love the chirashi! I'm giving in 3 stars but I would give it 4 for service!"
2,Overrated for some unknown reasons. But it's good to find a spot when it's too busy everywhere else on a Friday night.
2,"Best bar in Parkdale, best bar in Toronto, best bar in the world. The food is great. The drinks are the best around. Fam."
2,"I'm so excited about this place! Pierogi's have long been a source of comfort food, but these guys are doing something different that goes beyond the standard potato and cheese. Don't get me wrong, they have those too and they are DELICIOUS, but it's nice to have other options. What's cool about the Saucy Pierogi is that you get to experience food from around the world in a few tasty bites. I'm now officially a fan of jerk chicken (in pierogi form) and the feta and spinach are the perfect compliment to the meat or potato. I appreciate that they serve the food tapas style. Since I tend to get food FOMO, it's awesome to be able to try a bunch of different kinds for such reasonable prices! Lucky for us all, we get to take our favourites home at the end of the night. Would that I could do that in so many places!"
2,"I went to Chef of India with a bunch of co-workers for lunch. Seeing as it was buffet style and I only had an hour to eat it, I was rather disappointed. Those who know me, know that I like to eat for hours. Well on to the review...

I felt as though it was the same as any other indian restaurant and there was nothing too special about it. The food was good but I felt as though they had a very small selection. Although buffet style has you getting food for yourself, the service was great. I always had my glass of water filled and my plates were removed at a timely matter when I went for my second, third, and fourth serving. Like any other indian restaurant I start off with the Butter Chicken. I found it good, nothing too special. They also had food like Tandoori Chicken, Vegetable Pakoras, Eggplant, Lamb, etc. (The usual). The dessert was good aswell, they had icecream, and other Indian desserts. I would go back, but I wouldnt want to go back during work hours because once you finish eating you get that \""Itis\"" and you wanna go to bed!!"
3,"I'm a regular at this Pumpernickel's location. They have a nice selection of hot food, which usually changes daily. 

Some examples are chicken pot pie, fish, and meatloaf. You can get a side of salad or veggies, and rice or mashed potatoes. It's a little pricey but usually worth it. It's healthier than many other places in the food court. 

They have a number of staff who have been there for years and are very nice. Service is usually very good, including the older woman who works the cash. 

The one exception is a woman who recently started working there in the last month or two  She's usually in the hot food section. She's not rude, but she's not pleasant. She never smiles and looks bored to be there. Poor customer service upsets me. 

Due to her, I've starting going here less frequently (instead of 5 days per week, I go 3 to 4 days per week). However, I won't abandon it altogether because, overall, I've had a great experience at this place."
2,"The Old York is a nice little neighborhood place in an area where there just aren't a lot of nice little neighborhood places.  An interesting selection of beers on tap, suprisingly good food, friendly staff, and a great patio in the summer make this place my go-to in the neighborhood.  This is a great utility spot - good for quiet beers with pals, a casual dinner (the cuban sandwich is delish) or laid-back sunday bunch.  

My only gripe is that the small size can make it difficult to get a seat, although crowds here are inconsistent - on a Saturday night, you never know if you'll be the only one there, or will be left table-less."
2,Portions are rediculous at this location. They give you the smallest scoop of meat I've ever seen. Extremely disappointing. Also try are extremely rude and rush you. The cashier is ALWAYS miserable. Not going back here
2,"Service was okay and fairly quick (although they were not busy when I went). 
Food was.... Well, I left most of it on my plate (which I never do).  
My dining partner had the nachos, which were almost burnt and toppings portions were minimal. 
I had the Cobb salad with \""grilled\"" chicken... I hope the d&b owner sees the following suggestions and revamps the salad:
-the salad came on a \""bed\"" of ice berg lettuce. Which was really half a head of lettuce cut into quarters and put on the plate. I couldn't cut it into bit-sized pieces, and I also questioned how sufficiently my was washed, given that it was presented in two chunks on my plate. Would it be too difficult to tear up some lettuce, properly wash it, and put it on a plate?
-the cheddar cheese was cut into chunks and put on the plate. Was super awkward trying to cut into more reasonable pieces to eat with the salad. PLEASE consider grating the cheese!!!
-the \""grilled\"" chicken. Sigh. The chicken on my plate was paler than Lilith on Cheers, and had zero flavour. Pretty sure it comes to the restaurant cooked and they reheat it, or they cook it in the microwave. The chicken on my plate definite never saw a grill. Barely edible- zero flavour, weird texture, and super dry. 

Sorry, but I won't be back... I know d&b is known as a sports bar, but in addition to the nachos I've also had the wings and fish and chips in the past... Neither impressed. There are better places to watch the game, with both better atmosphere and better tasting food..."
2,"My Toronto friends were telling me about how amazing the burgers are here, so straight from the airport I was brought here to try it.  It was a good burger for sure, and it hit the spot, but it was far from the best burger in the world it was hailed as.  Kind of wish I went in expecting nothing, but I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and give them the 4* that I guess they deserve.  But I was pretty close to rating this 3*.  The meat was too well done for me."
2,"Cafe Polonez is like the next generation of Polish restaurants on Roncesvalles. The food is about the same, but instead of the charmingly scuzzy diner/pub surroundings, it has a clean, stylish look. (Think Sunset Grill with Kolbasa and cabbage.)

One of the highlights is definitely the White Borscht, which has chunks of sausage and hard-boiled eggs floating around in the delicious and thick broth. Other dishes can be hit-and-miss.

Be warned: there's a lot of choral Polish singing pumped through the restaurant, which can be charming or annoying, depending on your preferences."
2,Great food and amazing service. Came on a weekday with friends and they took care of us.
2,"We ordered 1/4 chicken leg and thigh take out, but it's totally burnt out. If you really want to eat here,  don't take out."
1,"We come here mainly for the food. It's a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant with about 10 tables. It's not aesthetically pleasing or instagram worthy if that's your concern. The portions are huge, enough to feed at least two. It's cash only so be prepared! There's usually a line out the door since there's limited seating. It's worth the wait for a cheap, delicious, hearty meal."
2,"Food was ok/good but service was totally brutal. 

Also, there was no tea! If you have brunch til 5pm you're sort of putting yourself out there as a hub for brunch, which means supplying the fundamental beverages is expected."
2,"First time trying Hogtown. I order a unchicken burger and supramacy fries. It was very tasty and i would like to keep Hogtown on my vegan list of choices.
The service was good and the kids liked it too.
I would recommend new comers!"
2,"We went to meet some friends for a birthday party. Originally they had called to make a reservation and they said they didn't take reservations of Friday. When they arrived there was some confusion \""oh, are you here for the reservation upstairs?\"
1,"The Pancakes and the Waffles are delicious, also the Eggs with bacon, the coffee, just everything  Did I mention the home fries? It's awesome to get a wonderful breakfast at a very low price.


 The staff is extremely friendly and attentive, the employees give you a smile and you have to smile back, automatically!


 Unfortunately, the Sunset Grill isn't an insiders' tip, so maybe you have to wait a couple of minutes."
2,"If I could give a minus I would

Food: Would have been plain bar food but each person at my table received it cold.

Parking: what parking there are 10 spots beside the restaurant that are owned by the city we had to wait 30+ minutes for a spot then had to pay.

Server: Great server who apologized for the food.

Manager: informed the manager (Adam I think) about the food he didn't really care. He looked like he should be washing the dishes instead of managing the restaurant.

Overall impression: Stay as far away from this restaurant as possible don't be surprised if they are out of business in the new year or so."
2,"This place is beyond beautiful. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I would definitely come back because the ambience is to die for. The wait was extremely long my friend and I got here around 215 on a Saturday afternoon and were told the wait would be an hour and 40 minutes- that's insane!!! They take your phone number and text when the table is ready. I went back to check about an hour later and she said we still had a 30 minute wait and there are only a few parties in front of us so hopefully they should call us soon. About 15 minutes later we finally got called and got seated. It was really frustrating waiting sooooo long especially when they had so many empty tables. It seems as though many people like to come and hang out here for many many hours with big groups of friends with no worry to leave at all. Quite ridiculous if you ask me! I get it, it's beautiful but come on!!!"
3,"Came across this restaurant on my way to a coffee shop and was attracted by the beautiful patio! 

So my gf and I were looking for a patio and decided to try this one out and see if it's as good as it looks! 

The patio and decor inside was amazing, definitely a great space for a quick drink or snacks. The main entree however I thought was a little underwhelming for the price they posted. We had gone for lunch and I ordered a lamb sausage pizza - which was so small in size and not filling at all, mind you Im a petite 5 ft 2 and don't require a lot of food to fill me up. The amount of lamb sausage on it was also very very minimal. My gf got a gnocchi with Japanese egg tofu which was decent and also not as filling. Food taste ok, but nothing extraordinary

All in all, It's an okay restaurant but I'd rather try a different place before returning"
2,"Since my last review, I find I can't stop coming here. The food is fantastic and staff are friendly. This is truly a nice place to eat, have a drink, take in a game, or even just read. Very relaxed and casual with a nice decor. 

I have tried the hamburgers, chicken vindaloo curry, and Steamwhistle beer-battered fish and chips. All were excellent. Cooked just the way I like it. 

This place seems to take pride in their food. The draft beers are always fresh. Cheers."
3,"The purpose of Summerlicious to most  of us is to try out new restaurants, appreciate their menus and services; thereby adding to our list for future visits. 

I would like to share, by far, the absolute worst Summerlicious experience I've had.  I do not recommend going to Trevor Kitchen and Bar unless you want to be met with an atrocious service and business ethic.  

Food - Do not order the surf and turf.  They do not ask you how you want your steak.  It turned out to be extremely tough. When I was cutting, my veins were actually showing from holding the meat down. \""Surf\"" also consists of one mediocre shrimp. Goat cheese poutine was seriously lacking some goat cheese taste. 

Atmosphere - The entire place was so dimmed that it could probably be dimmed hazardous. There was no pre-cautious tape or any proper lighting for the stair gaps, mind you the stairs were dark chocolate or even black. We received a table about a metre beside the kitchen in an alley with slippery floor. It smelled of the kitchen and we were only metres away from the fire and grease emanating from the kitchen.  There was no air conditioning at our corner which felt like the weather outside with humidity which was at 37 today.  There was only one ghetto white wired table fan - but mounted on wall - to keep the stale air moving away from the kitchen into our faces.  This table is unfit to serve customers in and we were given an unaccommodating attitude when we asked to switch.  

Service -  We were forced to pay for a meal we did not receive due to their unclear policy (about which, by the way, they were very inflexible).  When making a reservation, they should reiterate and make completely clear the policy that if your whole party doesn't show up, you will be charged for the price of the meal for the missing people unless you cancel in advance.  If we were told in advance we would have tried to cancel. First of all, we didn't even know about our one absence until the day of. Also, when we got there and told them we did not have our full party, they didn't inform us that we must pay for the one missing party.  

It was only when the bill came that we realized we would have to pay for the absent party.  They also made a mistake in calculation of our final bill.  When we complained about having to pay for a meal we didn't receive and not being properly informed of their inflexible policies, they spoke to us in a very condescending manner.  We did not care about having to pay an extra $5 per person.  The point is they clearly saw that we were upset and still held strongly that we should pay the extra person's meal and it was quote \""a risk we're willing to take\"" if we were to never return to their restaurant and to tell all our friends about their terrible service.  Clearly, they did not give us the time of day and thought very little of our group.  

They didn't tell us that if we had told them we would be missing someone they would seat a group of 7 in 3 tables for 2.  This means one person would have to sit at the head of the table.  3 people would have to sit a table meant for 2 at this cramped restaurant.  We demonstrated to the waitress that this was completely unreasonable by placing 3 entrée plates on our table and showing them how uncomfortable a dining experience that would have been.  Also to note, the surrounding odd numbered parties, ie 3 people, did NOT have to share one table. They also tried to justify that we were receiving a meal worth much more than the summerlicious price of $35.  However, I would argue that with their lackluster food, we would be paying $35 only for this restaurant's service and atmosphere, neither of which we received in any manner.  

They justified having to charge us for the extra person because of the lost revenue from the unsold seat.  However, in a group of 7, how could you sit comfortably in a table meant for 6?  There were also other odd number parties there at the same time.  Would they be charged for 4 since there was one unfilled seat? 

Last but definitely not least at the very end of it, the waitress suggested us to take the food to go (from the portion from the missing person). Within 3 minutes of handing us the menu, the waitress came back and said that the kitchen was closed, even the dessert bar, and quickly snatched away the menu. If there was no intention of giving us the meal which based on their policy we had to pay, why even give us that option?"
2,"DT Bistro seems to be suffering from a bit of an identity crisis. Is it a French patisserie? A Vietnamese fusion restaurant? A homey brunch place? From decor to menu, the whole place is a bit confused. That's not to say it's not delicious. Because it is very, very damn delicious.

My friend and I started with the mini Buttermilk Scones, served with lemon curd and raspberry jam. I ordered the Lemon Dill Scramble, with soft brioche, smoked salmon and asiago. My friend got the seasonal Soft-Shell Crab Sandwich on brioche with bacon and avocado. The scones were good and buttery, if a bit small. The jams were very tasty. My brioche was perfectly chewy against the scrambled eggs and the salty salmon, and the side salad (usually the bummer of the brunch plate) was delicious. My friend loved his sandwich, and again, the brioche nailed it. 

Even though we were stuffed, we had to try some of their desserts. DT has one of the most beautiful pastry cases I've ever seen - from tarts and cakes to cheesecakes and pastries. They definitely don't mess around. We chose the Double Dark Chocolate Tart, with dark chocolate shavings and blackberries, and the Creme Brûlée Tart with white chocolate, whipped cream and berries. Perfect buttery crusts, deep decadent fillings....we destroyed them faster than you can say \""time for cardio.\"
3,"This place is every hungry person's nightmare. First, the girl making my burger was so busy talking to her pal she forgot my order of fries. I had already waited 15 minutes at this point. When she finally handed me my bag something was telling me to check that everything was in there. When I pointed out that the fries (not cheap!) were missing, she nonchalantly brought them. \""Here you go\""! 
When I got home I opened the kale bowl and the stinky dairy smell of the dressing slapped me right in the face. I threw the $12 bowl straight in the trash. Never again."
2,"We love the roti! Come for the takeout, leave for the decor. It's not anything to look at, but if you are looking for a tasty filling meal, this is it. My favourites are the butter chicken roti and the saag paneer roti.

Tip: if you ask for \""mild,\"" it's still pretty spicy (for people who are likely to order mild). But, you can say \""no spice\"" and get it reeeeally mild.

Cash only but they have an ATM."
3,"Had no intention of coming here but while driving discovered it last minute. Strangely, found this location to be open on a Sunday which isn't the same for the other location we visited. Tiny restaurant, limited seating. The burgers are pricey here, around $16(?) for a combo includes a burger, drink, and fries. We found the menu pretty okay, we didn't know about their secret menu so we just ordered off the reg menu. Ordered double bacon cheeseburger, a high priest burger along with the combo. The fries were overly salted, the beef they use must have a high fat percentage because the oil was everywhere (soaked through the buns) it made the buns soggy and wet. Which I am not a big fan of, the burgers were good though- just don't expect anything lean. Ended up ordering their \""Ice cream cookie sangwich\"" with chocolate ice cream, you have different choices. It was really good and the ice cream didn't melt fast which made it even better. I am a fan of their food, but I would probably come back for their burgers and the ice cream cookie sangwich for sure."
2,"I'm not on the Poutini's train. It's fine but I've had way better in Toronto.

The main issue is the temperature of the gravy - it's not hot enough! The cheese curds remain completely unmelted. It's also not the most rich in flavour. 

My husband loves it so I've had it many times over the years and it is always the same. 

What I do like is the availability of fresh ground pepper, and the option of layering your poutine. 

I'd rather a poutine from Big Smoke Burger any day. If you haven't tried it, give it a go. Gravy is dark dark brown and you get some meltage."
2,"Commenting for dinner AYCE during weekday night.

Their short menu is made up by delicious sushi. Personally I'd prefer more extensive menu for AYCE, but if you're quality over quantity person, go for it.

Also, if you look at the menu, it's like they allow the customers to order each item 3 times only. I'm not sure for fact that they do this, so double check with the place.

Update: The current price for AYCE (as of April 2018) is $23+tax."
2,"Summary:
New Thai spot in the Mount Pleasant/Eg area. 
4 stars for food. 
Lunch special is good value. 
Wish their take out containers were plastic instead of styrofoam. 

Food:
I decided to try their lunch special and ended up getting the chicken pad thai. It was delicious - noodles weren't drenched in sauce, still chewy and the flavour was well balanced (salty, sweet, sour). 

I was told that the lunch portions are smaller than their dinner portions but it was plenty of food for me and I'm a big eater. Also, came with a side, which I chose the thai pumpkin soup, which was essentially similar to a butternut squash soup consistency/flavour, finished with a bit of coconut milk. 

Rating:
I give this joint a 4 stars but need to try other things on the menu."
2,"Wonderful dinner experience at the Elm Tree last evening.  As others have mentioned, a compact menu, but everything appeared thoughtful and delicious.  Our food was terrific and really felt like good value.  Our server was knowledgable and enthusiastic, guiding us through food and wine choices with real expertise.  In all, a nice relaxed dinner experience, I would definitely go again."
2,"September 6th, 2018 - I was going to a concert at Budweiser Stage and wanted CoCo before I got there. I was surprised to find out that one is not far from where I hang out sometimes. 

I ordered Mixed Juice Macchiato and my cousin ordered Green Tea Macchiato. I haven't tried the Green Tea Macchiato but that's the only one she gets. One day I will try it."
2,"We had a dreadful time here on December 14. The service was so slow, we had to ask what was wrong. Turns out, there was a party in the basement and they were under-staffed. Still, It took the waiter about 45 minutes to find out and tell us the wine we ordered was not available. The appetizers took another 45 minutes to arrive, and by then we needed another bottle of wine.  Do you think we could get a second bottle of the wine the waiter suggested for a replacement? Not likely. 

Dinner arrived eventually. We were told it took so long because one of our party ordered the \""Special\"" well done. It came cold. We had to wait almost an hour to over cook a cold meal?

When we complained, the waiter was very indignant. When we asked to speak to the manager, it took 3 tries to get him to come. Eventually, he offered to cover the cost of the wine. When the bill came, the 2 bottles of wine were still on the bill. When we asked to speak to the manager again, he would not come out. We found him and pointed out the errors on the bill. His comments were that the waiter was instructed to remove the cost of the wine and that it was the waiter's fault for not doing so. 

I am so terribly disappointed with this experience."
3,"shitty service, subpar food, cashier tried to short change me. never again. avoid if you care about yourself."
2,"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It looked pretty full, but they immediately seated the two of us.  I ordered some tea (which I think the waitress was disappointed with) and we started off with their dim sum appetizers.  For a main course I got the daily special which was prosciutto wrapped scallops with mashed yams on the side.  The meal was all good, but nothing spectacular.  I think, weirdly enough, my favorite part was the mashed yams.  

I know that some people here raved about the service, but I really found it somewhat lacking.  I realize that they were pretty busy, but everything took a much longer than it really should have.  However, I'd definitely be willing to give it another shot."
1,"Lovet his place. 
Great beer selection and awesome staff, food is cheap and delicious.

Nothing more to say other than everyone should come here.

Oh, but if you're with a crappy cell phone provider you probably wont get service due to it being in a basement."
2,"I have to admit that I'm not a easy person when restaurants is about, and I have to say that this restaurant surpassed  my expectations...  If you are looking for something new,  fresh and 100% food quality this is the place!!!  Excellent food,  amazing service,  and very nice place.  Definitely I will come back soon."
2,"**This 4 star is based on my Summerlicious experience.

One of the few places that offers a variety of items on its Summerlicious menu that attracts my taste buds.  Located on the Wellington strip, this basement establishment is simple, yet elegant.  No fancy decors or artwork, just some simple plants and lights, just dim enough to deliver the perfect ambience!  Romantic enough for a date, casual enough for a get-together with a group of friends, but classy enough so you wouldn't run into a bunch of teeny boppers throwing their 19th birthday there with tiaras.  Normally, it would take me years to decide what I like, but it just so happens that there were two dishes from each course that jumped out at us.

~APPS~
Potato-Crusted Crab Cake: 4/5 stars
I'm picky with crab cakes, but this batter was perfect and I can actually taste and see the crab! It could have been slightly hotter, but I guess that's what I have to sacrifice when I do Summerlicious.  It came out so fast that you know they have a batch in the back waiting to be dished out conveniently.

Macaroni & Asiago Cheese: 2.5 stars
Good. Nothing beyond that.  Small portion too, even for Sumerlicious.

~MAINS~
Surf and Turf: 4/5 stars
Sirloin with jumbo prawn served with truffled goat cheese poutine.  What wouldn't appeal to me in that dish?? Perfectly cooked steak and shrimp, delicious fries, and I love goat cheese!  The sauce was some sort of balsamic reduction which I thought was different, but tasty nonetheless.

Grilled Pork Chop: 3/5 stars
I don't care what the health board laws are, when I go out and get a pork chop at a restaurant with a good chef, I like my pork mid-well.  It's just that much juicier!  However, this was still good served with ancho chilli apple sauce, haricots verts, and red cabbage.  A slight twist on classic pairings!

~DESSERT~
Creme Brulee: 3/5 stars
You can't really go wrong with a classic vanilla bean creme brulee. Slightly under-settled for me... a bit runny, but still good.

Dark Chocolate and Caramel Torte: 4 stars
Served with... get ready... PEANUT BUTTER CHANTILLY! Who doesn't like peanut butter cream with chocolate? Slightly sweet for me, but I'm not really a dessert person.  But anyone who loves sweets, chocolate, and peanut butter will orgaz to this!

Service: 4 stars
Very attentive with servers and food runners.  A little lack in friendliness but oh hell, it's Summerlicious and it was busy... though a smile here and there wouldn't hurt.  Cutlery is changed after each course, and linen napkins will be refolded every time you come back from the bathroom.

Overall, great experience for the price of $35 pp.  Food was not amazing to taste, but delicious.  You can definitely tell that time and care was put into the cooking and prep of all the dishes."
2,"I'm a huge fan of cajun seafood and have had mixed to none existent opportunities to have it in Toronto. Captain's Boil does a good job of satisfying that urge and offers up boiled seafood in bags which you can add flavouring like garlic, cajun or all mixed together in a \""captain's boil\"" which is highly recommended. Lock and load your gloves & bibs cause eating here is messy but good fun as long as you accept what it is and dive into the saucy goodness at the bottom of those bags. The menu isn't limited to seafood, they have awesome cajun fries, corn and plenty more in an ever growing menu. The cajun shrimp here is the best I've had in the city and your pretty much guaranteed to have a good time here unless you get sauce on a nice shirt you shouldn't have been wearing to eat here. Only real downside to the place is they can be a little inconsistent with the captain's boil sauce. Sometimes the mixture is cajun perfection, and sometimes its just red sauce that leaves you wondering what went wrong. The location on Yonge near Wesley is the weakest of all the locations I've been to. If its your first time going try to avoid that specific location as they are stingy on the sauce and their proportions on the sauce mixes are a far cry from the other locations."
2,"Fantastic selection of cider. The \""prosthetic\"" and \""pinot noir\"" ciders were wonderful. The \""TP\"" /pine cider was really solid.  Beet salad and cheese plates had great flavour.  The buttermilk chicken tasted great by itself, and the spicy dip had a up-your-nose horseradish/wasabi kick.  Fun to alternate between eating the chicken with and without dip.

The place was packed and we didn't have a reservation. Lucky to get a seat for an hour.  Next time we will have to make sure to do so.  Will go back to try more cider and food."
2,"aka: Large Indian Buffet

My sister recommended trying this small mom & pop shop out. They offer under 20ish buffet items (butter chicken, tandoori chicken, aloo gobi, naan bread, basmati rice) and many other vegetarian dishes. It's buffet style so upon arrival you'd seat yourself, grab a plate, and proceed to get your food.

I was quite impressed with the variety of dishes as well as the authentic flavourful taste! They're really good with replenishing dishes so the food is consistently hot. I would definitely suggest trying this place out!

Meat buffet is $10.99 - veggie buffet is $7.99, you can also purchase pop for $1 and other juices"
2,"I ordered the \""salad and meat\"" dish for lunch today using the Ritual app. I felt like trying something new and had never ordered from this place before. 

Well, this really wasn't a salad at all. It was a giant pile of iceberg lettuce with a few slides of under ripe tomato and bits of carrot and a chicken skewer. 

It came with two sauces. One resembled tzatziki sauce and the other was an unrecognizable dark, blobby sauce. I didn't dare to try it. 

I really don't recommend this place, for meat or veggie eaters. Nothing special and it left me underwhelmed."
2,Good local neighbourhood spot. Pretty decent Greek souvlaki and chicken Greek salad options.  It's a charming local diner. Manage your expectations and you'll be pleased.
3,"I've heard good reviews about Jinya from a couple of friends, so I was eager to give this restaurant a try when I was in the area. 

Environment:
The restaurant is located near the College/Church intersection, which is very much TTC accessible. If you're driving there is also a private parking just right across the street.
Upon walking into the restaurant, the ambiance emitted more of a bar/izakaya vibe, as supposed to the other ramen restaurants that I frequent. There was a coat rack right by the entrance to hang your winter jacket. Going along with the bar vibe, there were many TVs around the perimeter of the restaurant with sports on. 
The dining space was good sized, but many of their tables were only good for up to 4 people, and larger groups would have to use the high tables in the middle. There were also couple ledge seats available by the window and by the open kitchen for solo diners. 

Food:
My friends highly recommended their Takoyaki so for sure I was going to try it. It was $6.95 for 6 pieces, so the price was reasonable. However, I find their Ramen bowls to be on the more expensive side, as the prices ranged between $12 to $15. 
We received the Takoyaki first as it was our appetizer, and I really like how it tasted with the Japanese mayo sauce at the bottom, that I kept it for flavouring when our ramen arrived. The texture of the Takoyaki was really tender and fluffy and it tasted great when it was hot. 
We waited for quite a long time for our Ramen to arrive, which was quite a bummer as ramen is supposed to be a type of \""fast food\"" in Japan. When it finally arrived I was slightly disappointed by the portion size and the toppings, considering that I was expecting more due to the higher prices. The soup turned out to be too salty to the point that I wished I had told them to give me -50% salt when I placed my order. The Chashu pork was really tender, but it didn't really standout for me, similar to the rest of the toppings. 

Service:
To be honest, when I realized the restaurant was going for the izakaya vibe I was expecting loud chants from the staffers, but thank god it wasn't the case during my experience. I was at Kinka recently where they did that constantly, and it felt like the noise was going to burst my eardrums at any moment.
In terms of service, you don't really get an assigned server to your table, so you're free to get a hold of any server walking by to place your order. They came over periodically to clear the dishes and to refill our water as well. 

Overall, I think the restaurant is a 3.5 star for me, but for the sake of the review I'm giving it a 3 star, because the ramen was so average and the portion wasn't very big, so I can't justify paying a premium price for it."
2,"Really enjoyed the Rustic Breakfast and the small back patio. The portions were very generous, so you better be hungry. Otherwise, the bagel may be a better choice. My gfs Eggs Benedict was good too. She preferred the avacado over the spinach. My only complaint would be the lack of shade on the patio and that some college kids at the table next to us were smoking."
2,"Went for a work luncheon with within a group of 7. Super friendly staff and a lovely menu. 

Everyone was super happy with their orders. Myself I had the lamb pita and it was amazing - I plan to return for this as well want to try the tea service."
2,"Easily one of the best restaurants in Toronto. I had the chorizo and octopus. The flavour combinations were excellent. I then had the Arctic char and this also was cooked to perfection. My gf had the gnocchi although tasty to  would call it a far stretch as gnocchi. All in all nearly everything was cooked to perfection. 

Great experience"
3,"This place used to be called Mr. Tonkatsu. Though the menu looks nicer it's prices seem to have gone up. 

The only reason I am giving this place three stars is the price to satisfaction ratio. The piece seemed small and the only way you would feel satisfied is if you eat the whole mound of rice (which isn't a good idea if you want to avoid getting diabetes). Parking spaces there are very limited and the AC was out so it felt a bit warm. 

Another thing though I am not penalizing them for it is I felt like I was invisible to the waitress staff. To the point that my friend had to let them know to take my order. I just found it funny and decided to laugh it off. 

The taste is good. The flavour of the meat shows through. The toasted sesame with tonkotsu sauce mixed with worsteshire sauce makes a good mix. Even their salad was great. 

However for $14 for the amount even given the area. I found it too expensive. And the portion was small for dinner. 

Crazy don is larger if you want better value."
2,"We were here last night.  The bar itself is nice.

Pros:
The bottle service hostesses are really nice.
The decor is nice.  Love the brick interior walls.

Cons:
The bouncers were less than desirable, not the nicest, but I guess that's a part of the job.  There seemed to be some confusion about what list you're on.  Perhaps the communication between teams can be improved.
The DJ doesn't take requests, so you're kind of at his mercy.  The security people inside acknowledged that he wouldn't take requests.  It seems he's a big Drake fan, and doesn't like the Black-Eyed Peas.  Too cool for Top 40?
Also, they've put a bottle service station anywhere it could fit, so there's very little room to move around.  I guess someone had a lesson in space and profit optimization.
The bottle service line (outside) is longer than the regular line.
The bathrooms were also questionable.

No Chill vibe here."
2,"I never tried Hakka before, this was an amazing experience!"
2,"Pretty good mexican flavours, service is fast, efficient and friendly.  Make sure to check in for the free tortilla chips.  They are done very well.

I got the guac and chips and this guac is one of the best ones I've had."
2,"This is the only pho place I like! I just get the regular pho with only raw beef, it's delicious every time :) 

It's more of a family restaurant. Service is not bad for an Asian place."
1,"I have been wanting to come here for a little awhile.  My friend and I went to the ROM, and this place was a brisk walk away.  We got there just before it opened, but their doors were open.  The waitress said we were welcome to sit but they were still getting the restaurant ready.  It was nice of her not to make us wait outside in the cold!  

It's very bright and inviting.  An adorable spacious cafe, with a beautiful living wall.  I really liked the menu selection.  There were a lot of different choices, and unique options that you wouldn't typically see at a Cafe. 
 So many things I wanted to try!  I ended up with a pizza, latte and a waffle for dessert.  Everything was delicious, presentation was very cute, and the portion sizes were perfect.  Quite affordable, the prices weren't outrageous, and the service was incredibly welcoming and friendly. 
 

I look forward to coming back!"
1,"First thing to start off - excellent pricing! $4.95 for all items - where else could you find that?! Nevertheless, you're paying for what you're getting, so don't come in here expecting exquisite cuisine. There is quite a wide range of food items so it caters to everyone. I came here on a weekday at around 2pm, so there wasn't too much of a crowd.

Service - I was alone and the hostess didn't seem too polite. It was the friendly bartender/manager(?) that took my order and made sure my glass wasn't ever empty. It was hard trying to get the waitresses' attention, since they all looked preoccupied. The wait for my single order took at least 15 minutes, which was a bit disappointing.

Food - again, don't expect the most gourmet food for $4.95. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and yam fries. The burger was nice and hot, and the brie bun was soft and great. I found the meat a bit too overseasoned and that there was a serious lack of veggies for my taste. Overall, still a good burger for $5. The yam fries were cut too thinly and didn't have the fluffy inside I was looking for. Also, the seasoning on the fries were bland and it was evident that the potatoes weren't that fresh because they weren't sweet at all.

Generally, a good place when you're running low on cash and just wants to grab a bite. The atmosphere is great if you have a few friends along and it was an overall enjoyable experience."
1,"This place is ok. It's huge. I arrived with one friend and we were seated at a crappy table RIGHT beside another couple (with a baby - ugh) even though the place was empty. We asked the hostess to move to a booth, and we might as well have asked her to perform brain surgery because she was terribly confused. After some back and forth we were moved to the booth. 
The prime rib was decent and the sides were alright. For $40 I guess I can't complain. The bread is delicious."
2,Polite and friendly service. Delicious pour overs and baking. Spacious and comfortable.
2,"I went there tonight to get some wings with my boyfriend. We both ordered wings and some perogies to share. They had a lot of things on the menu (would probably be a good thing to cut it down), and a number of sauces to choose from. While the food was great (the hot sauce was actually hot), the service was lacking. There was only one waitress tending to the tables and at one point she disappeared. Even when she was on the floor, other tables were tended to more. 

Again, while the food was tasty, I wouldn't find myself running to come back here."
2,"1st review on Yelp, here goes...

Went to O&B Canteen on a Thursday after work for drinks and dinner.  It was a nice day so we decided to sit on the patio that faces King St - we had no problems getting a seat for dinner around 530pm.  I have been for lunch with coworkers several months before and the wait time can be long if you do not arrive before noon. 

Menu (4/5): From what I understand, the restaurant is intended to give off a casual, market-like feel and the menu seems to successfully accomplish this.  Well categorized between sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, comfort/diner food, etc.  There is variety but not too much variety to complicate ordering.  There should be something for everyone here, but at the same time you don't feel like the restaurant's vision is diluted by the selection.  Descriptions and ingredients are simple, which also goes well with the Canteen feel.

Food (3/5): I had the Mac & Cheese and tasted the Beef Burger.  The cheese was much more saucy than I anticipated and very rich, however it tasted very good and the morsels of smoked ham were delicious.  The Beef Burger also tasted good.  Good quality beef and it came with a heaping side of fries (which are some of the best fries I've had).  The burger comes on a nice egg bun, but I feel they need to put some greens in the burger to offset the heaviness.  Presentation-wise, it looks like a slab of meat in a bun with fries.  Perhaps it was intended that way.  Other diner's plates looked good.  Overall the food was solid, nothing mind-blowing or something I would come back for often.

Drinks (2/5): Limited beer selection on tap (2) and quite pricey at 7.50-8.50 for a pint.  Several bottled beer options though.  Similarly, wine by the glass is pricey but there should be a wine with the grape of your choice.  Not a place where you feel like sitting for a long time to drink.

Ambiance (3/5): I thought they did a great job with the decor and ambiance - very upscale cafeteria type of feel.  I feel like it blends in well with the building, street, and area.  Would recommend this restaurant moreso for a nice lunch/brunch.  I don't find it a relaxing place to have dinner.  Special note: the Patio can be extremely noisy and distracting since the patio is pretty open to the street.  So if you are going after work, be prepared for a lot of honking cars, firetrucks, street cars, and pedestrian traffic.  Found it quite distracting to be on the Patio for dinner.  

Service (4/5): No delays for drinks or food.  Friendly staff.  Waiter made some recommendations after I asked what the popular items are.  

Value (3/5): Menu prices are reasonable for the quality/portion that you get.  Should offer more lower-priced drinks."
2,"I quite enjoyed the king mushrooms and chicken.   The noodles that come with the lobster are soft.   The choices of seafood, and the different sizes give patrons the choice.

The general tsao chicken was tastefully done and included diced tomatoes.   Their specials help to keep the bill down."
2,Got the pho noodle special and had no complaints. Large for 10.99 was very filling. Service was excellent.
2,"Great food and great service! I had the quesadilla and it was full of flavour! The meat was tender and well seasoned. The vegetables were very fresh. I'd like to point out the jalapeños were actually fresh and spicy! Amazing experience, will be back!"
2,"After having weak drinks with dinner nearby and coming close to our 2 hour table time allocation, we decided to hit up THITW for what we hoped would be proper drinks.

This place did not disappoint.  It has the ambiance of a very small local bar. I lived it.  And the bartender was very nice. We were dressed up so sort of stood out, but we were treated very well. I know this sounds basic....but you would be surprised. 

The drink menu had many classics, and were very well made which earns 4 stars.  While we were there, I have to admit, even though I was full from an earlier dinner, I was having some food envy. I saw beef ribs and what looked to be duck wings....and they looked amazing! Next time I will be coming here to try some of the food!"
2,still good but their quality is definitely slipping.  Maybe they are coasting on their reputation but its not as good as it used to be but still very good.
2,"Why eat dessert at the restaurant you had dinner at. When in the area after a great meal with friends I will always take them to Demetre's for Dessert as there is nothing better. Friendly Staff, Great Atmosphere, and even better Desserts."
1,"Went here to have lunch with a friend during the work week. This location has been many different restaurants in the past. Some of them ok, some of them downright yucky. But Crazy Wings is good, decent food for reasonable prices.

I had the Tofu Teriyaki lunch & my friend had the Salmon Teriyaki lunch. At 6.99 & 8.99 the prices are standard for lunch. If I were to nitpick I wish  they included just a couple more cubes of tofu in the lunch order. Music in this place was an improvement to the previous establishment which only played Korean pop songs. Sorry, for a non-Korean I find that music annoyingly whiney & repetitive. The decor hasn't changed much inside except for those lit bottles on the wall. Outside tho, they built a nice patio. The waiter did a good job, except he got a little confused with the cutlery, which made us laugh. :-) I got two forks & my friend only got 1 knife. So I gave her my second fork & she gave me her knife."
2,"Good food and great atmosphere. The kale salad was delicious. We also had the meatballs, spring rolls,  side ribs, thia vegetables, and chicken.  There were 3 of us and I didn't leave hungry but I wasn't full either."
2,"Walked by a couple of times but the line was really long so waited until today. I should have walked away when I hit the front of the line. First the guy was unwrapping the gyros and they looked they had just been defrosted. Having waited 20 minutes I had committed to this and wasn't going to leave. The second thing that came to my attention was the lack of organization. There were roughly a dozen  employees back there but the line was crawling. I don't blame them as the owner should be there to delegate and move the line along. There were delays along my entire order with literally 4 employees standing near the cashier doing nothing. They had two cashiers but were only operating one. Once again I ask the owner why not have two cashier's? I hope the owner reads this as I hope you succeed but right now I honestly believe this is just a pure hype and people seeing a line. Honestly the plate was mediocre and I've had better hummus at the supermarket. Honestly if you want a better plate go up the road to Cumberland and there is a $5 dollar shawarma plate place, pay the extra for meat and pay $2 for 4 fallafel balls and you'll still spend less than this place. Honestly I fell victim to the hype and social media."
2,Went for lunch with a friend.  He had steak and calamari to start.  I had the halibut with ceasar salad to start.  Waitress was friendly and very warm even if we stayed well pass the lunch rush.  I would recommend it and will return there again.
3,"Everything on the outside makes it look like a burger joint. Ironically, they don't have any burgers. Selection of food is limited, overall quality is ok. Price is high though. For the Patty Melt it end up being $19.21 with tax for a patty on rye bread with French fries!"
2,"The food was great but the service was pretty bad. It took us ages to get the attention of the waitress when we needed something. Also it's pretty annoying that they would refuse to split the bill at the end.

They ran out of mole, the previous time they ran out of green salsa."
2,"I love this place! Highly recommend the Bangkok Pad Thai & the Thai Dumplings 

Service is always great too"
2,"I was here a few months ago and the food was really good.  I visited today and the food was ok.  The chicken tacos were good.  The steak and calamari were ok.  Today we were served by two waitresses.  The first one was very friendly, the second didn't seam too genuine.  I guess the inconsistency isn't just in the food.

This is a great place to go with colleagues after a day at the office.  Nice ambiance, nice patio (if you don't get a smoker next to you), mostly friendly staff.  Convenient location."
1,"Okay, this place is AMAZING. 
The place looks like a school cafeteria, the place is small, but WHO CARES?

1) The crepes are AMAZINGLY GOOD (I went to cafe crepe afterwards cus i couldn't NOT eat  crepe, they damaged my taste buds with their thick, pancake-like crepes) 

2) They are CHEAP. (I paid 6dollars for coffee + crepe. I paid 10 at cafe crepe, i guess the portion was bigger there but it didn't taste good)

3) The staffs are nice.

4) Tips are optional! Although i always tip them cus the food is too good not to tip :D"
2,"This food is good...for drunk people with no taste left. The parmegina was soggy, and fries were a horrible choice. The pizza looked good, wish we got that instead."
2,"Cool ambience, select beers from small breweries, friendly and knowledgable  owner. The space is a long column, pinball and arcade machines against the right wall (~12 machines), tables to the left, and a bar to the back. Electronic background music, not loud, dim lighting. Pinball is $1 and arcade machines a quarter. 10/10 would go again!"
1,"- can't go wrong with a delicious $2.50 banh mi sandwich
- great bread. assorted meats is the king
- hits the spot, and you won't be disappointed."
2,"Crazy cool bar with kick ass drinks. It's very hidden but once you're in, everyone is super nice. Very gatsby like."
2,I had (1)  sangria here one hot afternoon and it gave me the WORST headache for more than a day. yuck
2,"I live in the neighborhood and every time I passed by there would be a long line up outside on the street so I figured this place must be doing something right. Yes, long line up day after day and it's always packed inside ; you get the picture. One day I passed by and there were only 5 people waiting so I gathered today is my lucky day and I had to thank god for giving me this opportunity to order their food..... I had the beef gyros and I must say  I'm sorry I apologize to myself inside my mind. It's way too oily and salty, with a cold soft wrap. Now I understand the real meaning of \""hype\"". This 1-star is only my opinion. Try it for yourself to be fair."
2,"I like to eat south eastern foods and this was my first time trying out butter chicken. My friend recommended me to this place. I read on other reviews that for the special, you can ask for a substitute of a naan if you didn't want to ride. I did that and wow it was really good! Will definitely come back to try their other foods."
1,"Not the best looking place, but the employees are really friendly. I always count on Wanda's for a late night dessert that doesn't fail to satisfy my sweet craving every time! My go to dessert spot around Dundas square for a fair price."
2,"We visited Woodlot on July 24, 2011.  Even though food was quite memorable, it didn't make up for the slow and unwelcoming service.  We got to the restaurant at 8:30pm, everything was running smoothly until we got our appetizers.  It was about 9:45pm and we were still waiting for our entrees.  Our waitress seemed undisturbed by us waiting over 40 min for our mains, until I requested to speak to the manager.  It was then, when they offered a free dessert, (which we didn't have time to eat).  I don't recommend going to this place, there are plenty of good places in the city with efficient and welcoming service.  The good food doesn't make up for the lousy service.  I guess Toronto Life had it wrong this time."
2,"* 3.5 stars

Son-of-a-viche! What a disappointment!

As soon as my friends and I walked in, I knew this place was for me. Not fancy in any want, lots of accolades on the wall and it had that great ma-pa shop feel. 

I, too, had the ceviche and felt pretty let-down by it. I've certainly had worse, but when everyone raves, you have to try it out. Not enough citrus zing, the shrimp seemed a little dry and I was hoping for a little kick.

Following that, I followed suit and had the carne asada. For such a simple dish, I was happily surprised. The beef was cooked perfectly,  chock-full of flavour and even tastier with the spicy side of onion and peppers. 

Like Lauren M mentioned, the plantains chips totally kicked. Big on flavour, small on oil and the sides were massive.

So, despite the slow start with the ceviche, things really picked up with the main and the rest of the menu looked solid as well, so I'll definitely be back."
2,"Food is excellent but they were so caught up with presenting their \""standard\"" as an open faced burger that they would not even cut my burger in half!  Pathetic. As a restaurant owner myself I am justified to suggest they have to realize the customer is always right and to drop their arrogance of presenting it \""their way\"" when they aren't the ones eating it. Wake up. Sad."
1,"We recently held our wedding (the ceremony and reception) at Tappo and it was a great experience! The staff is amazing, very open, friendly, and honest. They ensured that all of our guests were fed and fed they were! Everyone raved about the food and we had a fantastic wedding thanks to Tappo. Overall great food, great wine, and great service!!"
2,"HANDS DOWN THE BEST BURRITO IN TORONTO. It's difficult and somewhat awkward explaining to someone that your favourite lunch in the world is a fish burrito, but that's exactly the predicament I frequently find myself in. I used to go for the chicken until a colleague wisely guided me toward the halibut. I was apprehensive at first but wow, what an incredible meal. With the halibut your stomach doesn't feel nearly as weighed down as with the chicken or beef. Then there is the construction. A burrito should be built and folded in such a way that you can eat it without getting a single drop on your plate or your hands. If you do, then either it wasn't constructed right or you need to improve your burrito eating skills. Burrito Boyz always builds their burritos right, so if you spill any, it's your fault!"
1,"Small shop in Kensington. Just dropped in for an empinada and chose the beef and jalapeno. Simple ground beef and mild spicy flavour. At $3.00, t'was quite nice."
2,"I've never had Detroit style pizza before but I am now a fan. I had the double pepperoni and was surprise to find the crust very light and fluffy with crispy edges and great taste. I also had the Jafna which has an amazing combination of sweet, savory and spicy flavors. It is the best vegetarian pizza I've ever had. We were lucky at being seated within 5 min, but they only a few tables.The staff was friendly and service was fast. This place is definitely a treat."
2,"Very impressed with the quality of food. 

I was brought here by a friend who lives nearby of this restaurant. She recommended their chicken soup, which turns out to be really good. It's definitely a rare healthy option for dinner.

For me, I had the spicy pork bowl with rice. The bowl was huge and I couldn't finish the meal. It comes with a soup too.

I recommend both of the said dishes if anyone decided to give this place a try. 

I'd personally go back to try other dishes, as they seemed good too from the people that ordered those."
3,"I enjoyed the vegetarian sushi combo, however I felt it was a bit overpriced.  I think the bento boxes are of better value as they're quite large compared to other sushi restaurants. The place itself is ok. There's no air conditioning  so during hot days it feels a little stuffy in there."
2,"I would have given a 5* but the service has definitely declined dramatically. The food is still amazing and fresh so I will continue to eat here for weekday dinners. The best dish is the beef tenderloin. My friend and I would order sometimes 6 of these but they started to catch on and bring the tiniest portions so it's best to emphasize YOU WANT THE BEEF TENDERLOIN. Then you don't have to keep bothering the waitress every 10 seconds for a refill. Also the yellowfish is $2 extra charge and not unlimited, not sure if that's standard but I do not recommend for lunch because all the best dishes aren't offered. Hot sake, edamame, avocado salad, terriyaki!
Tip: ask about becoming a VIP for 10%, also cash discount"
2,"Had an amazing experience here.

The food we ordered (squid, tartare, burger, and tagliatelle) were all amazing, extremely fresh tasting and not overly heavy. 

The service was attentive and friendly. It is a very inviting place to bring a date.

Have to say it is by far my favourite burger in Toronto. Until next time."
3,"I'm not sure how many people come here for fresh produce, but they do have a great selection of prepared foods. There's a self serve salad bar ($2.49/100g), a salad and yogurt bar where you can order freshly prepared salads, pizzeria, sandwich bar, hot food bar, and sushi bar. They also have a Greenhouse juice bar, a vegan bake shop (incredibly overpriced - $5.50 for a cupcake seems a little steep), which are operated by third party vendors. 

It's great option if you're looking for elevated food court fare, that's quick and ready to go. 

There is limited seating in the grocery store, and it gets fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon so be prepared to eat your food elsewhere."
2,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been going here for years. I always get some roasted garlic, farmer's cream cheese, hummus and my mini pitas and/or crackers. Staff are always lovely. Only once did I find mouse teeth marks that had chewed threw my mini pita bag."
2,"Really small space, good ambiance. Kitchen is tiny but they crank out the dishes.  The alcohol program was a bit lacking for me. Beer and cocktails were boring. Stronger wine list but a touch pricey.  Big menu, but with a table of four you can order the whole thing. The portion sizes are really small, almost two small to split between two people let alone four. That's my major complaint, portion size.  Execution was on point, no duds, mostly winners.  Eggplant pasta was great. You can try horse tartate here, you have to do it.  This place needs some tweaks but I'd come back and potentially be a regular."
2,"cons: had to wait for almost an hour, was told to wait outside in the cold (understandable because of the small space), our mains took a while because it got \""lost\"" but they found it 

Pros: fresh foods, real hearty ingredients, fresh toast is really yummy, good ambience, fast service"
2,"The fiancé was getting a haircut nearby, after we decided to check out what was behind those huge iron fortress looking doors ~ 

We came on a saturday afternoon, around lunch time. It was busy but we got lucky a table just cleared up for us. Their menu had a lot of choices, but not so much where you feel overwhelmed.  This was a tapas styled bar, had a lot of appetizers, but we wanted to try their udon dishes instead.  

{Corn Kaki-age}
So for the first appetizer we ordered the corn kaki-age because I LOVE CORN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.  I expected it to be sorta just like the mayo and baked cheese on top kinda corn. But it came out in 5 \""fried corn cheese balls\"". It also had a light sweet mayo dipping sauce. When we bit into it....oh my gawjjjjjj IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I felt like they added cheese to hold it altogether. And that was GENIUS CAUSE IT WAS ALL SO GOOD. A little bit crunchy from the fried cheese, light creamy mayo taste that complimented the corn x 1000000! To be honest I would be happy to just eat 3 orders of this fried corn cheese ball dish!! Highly recommend this to everyone that loves corn and cheese!! 

{Spicy Salmon Tartare}
Was gonna order the takowasa  like usual, but was feeling adventurous and wanted to try more tartare (like my Nome tartare experiance )! So I ordered the spicy salmon tartare. This dish came with deep fried wonton skin chips. The flavour was phenominal! This looks like a simple salmon tartare dish with crushed black peppers and habanero oil, but the flavours are rich and complexed. The habanero oil they used really brought out the salmon! I was surprised that they didn't use sriracha and mayo, which is what I'm used to. But mixed the salmon in habanero oil and adding the mayo on top for you to mix. I loved the aroma of the habanero oil, it really compliments the salmon.  The only thing I didn't like was that the salmon cubes were a bit too big. It was weird to eat giant cubes of salmon on such a small triangle of wonton skins. Nevertheless it was a refreshing dish to our creamy udon dishes! 

{Salmon Cream Sauce Udon}
We both wanted to try the cream sauce udon, so he chose to order the salmon cream sauce udon. When the dish arrived it was interesting seeing the tomato oil on top! I've never seen tomato oil before  The salmon was cooked PERFECTLY! We both were so impressed, it was tender, and very rich with umami flavours. It tasted like it was cooked with garlic which we LOVED. The udon was cooked just right for us. We like it not too hard but just soft enough where it has texture when you bite down When you mixed everything together, the crazy umami flavours from the garlic salmon, the tomato oil, and the cream sauce oh my gawwwwwj! It's delicious! Not too rich either which was very surprising, because of the amount of cream sauce in the dish. But of course if you decide to finish all the cream...that would be a bit too creamy then.  Very impressed with our first udon choice!

{Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon} 
I saw a post of a fellow foodie with the mentaiko cream sauce udon dish and I had to try it!  The mentaiko came on top of a shisho leaf with chopped green onions. I know was meant to be mixed together but it was so pretty. Took me a little while before mixing everything together.... The flavour of this pasta dish was also phenomenal! Although the mentaiko flavour is not really strong due to the amount of cream, but the spicy tomato oil still added a lot of rich umami flavours (and look at that gorgeous colour it adds to the dish!!). I would still prefer more of the spicy mentaiko flavour though.  Like the other cream sauce udon, this was also complexed in flavour!  I still enjoyed this dish very much! The udon noodle itself was also cooked perfectly to our liking. We were very very impressed with this cream sauce udon as well! We were happy we finally got to try out this place for lunch time. Next time I would like to try out their sukiyaki dish!"
1,"This place is one of my favourite go to's. For the price, you get a lot of food, especially if you are getting the protein bowls or the sushi bowl. Great atmosphere as well, as i study here on occasions; yes, they have wifi. Will come back again and again."
1,"Somehow I end up at the Mandarin once or twice a year.....for about 20 years now.
My dining experience here each of those times has been pretty much identical. This surprises me. Time after time after time, it's the same. It hasn't got better, hasn't got worse.

Selection: Large. Shrimp, to crab legs, to roast beef, to teppanyaki to pizza, to soups etc....
                Don't come here for the sushi, though they have it.
                Possibly the largest dessert selection I've seen

Fresh:  Yes. It's always busy so replenishment is continuous. 

Ambiance:  Your only reason to come here should be to eat. Get my drift?
                  And it's always busy. Always.

Service: Very attentive and friendly. Plates cleared, waters refilled, new drinks brought, all right when you need it. 

Price: Appropriate for what you get."
2,"Besides the pepperoni and cheese you have spinach and feta. And a rather wild assortment of twenty or so pizzas on display for the vegetarians and carnivores. The emphasis here is more on the topping flavours because of a thinner crust.  A slice and pop is about $5.  

The rating system of Yelp asks me if this place is good for kids.  I don't know, I mostly go here after midnight when it's full of drunk and stoned university kids.  It's good for them though.

Add the red-bottled hot sauce yourself.  It is usually beside the pop vending machine."
2,"I used to order from this place all the time when I worked in the area. I would get the same thing each time: falafel with fries and a Coke.

Maybe not the healthiest combo you can think of, but the kicker was this was all for $3.99! And even though I don't drink Coke much anymore it was the coldest, freshest taste after eating those delicious fries. The falafel was obviously the main course and downright delicious.

The staff was always so nice to me even though I only got a cheap combo every time. Definitely a great place to hit up on your lunch break -- quick and incredibly easy on the wallet."
2,"Great food and great service! Compared to other locations, this one is very spacious which is great if you have kids or in a group of more than 6. I will definitely recommed going to this place specially during lunch time because of the combos that they offer."
1,"amazing place, great for take-out (the actual dining area is VERY hot) had the lamb jalfrezi and my friends had the butter chicken, huge delicious portions they are well-priced. I ordered mine medium spicy (7 out of 10) and didn't fit it very spicy at all so I would suggest ordering up a spice level from what you are used to at other indian restaurants."
2,"Came here bc I was craving ribs, I was thoroughly disappointed in the ribs. They were not fresh they were dry and tough. The brisket we had was good, but the beans were cold and the cheddar corn bread was just cornbread? 
Nothing special about this place, I had high expectations given the reviews and a friends recommendation, but I was disappointed. I hate when new restos do so well and then let quality slip over time, it's unfortunate."
2,"So, I've bought cheese, groceries, had coffee and food at this place regularly. It's a few steps from my office. 

I absolutely love it. I love everything about it. 

If you are buying a cheese selection, just tell them what do you like, and what's your budget, they will try to keep UNDER your budget. That's so nice! The results are always amazing, I want to buy cheese there every day. 

I have ordered the beet salad, which is beautiful and delicious, and their pizza is incredible, thin crust, house made tomato sauce. I've seen, but never ordered, the cheese and charcuterie board, and it looks so beautiful, I have to go there just for that. 

All the orders come with their own bread selection, olive oil, nodini cheese and ask for the house hot sauce!  

If you have any questions about the menu, ask Andrea, the manager, he's super friendly and will love to talk to you about the food they make. There's someone who loves their job and is very dedicated to their customers. 

Alimento also offers samples of their food in the grocery so you can taste before you buy (or... you can be easily convinced to buy everything because everything tastes SO GOOD), and that's how I decided I'm totally buying their olive oil - BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME. 

Seriously. I love this place. These italian dudes, they know their stuff. I give them all my money."
2,"Service was great. Wasn't crowed at 10 pm ( closing is 11pm). Received food quickly and the waiters were very polite. I enjoyed my food ( I had shrimp, snow crab legs, and sausage... they were out of corn). Next time I am in Toronto I will be returning ... this is my go to seafood spot."
2,Went for brunch. Service was excellent and quick. I got the breakfast poutine which was so amazing. Now I want to go back and try another dish.
2,"One big reason I do not intend to move for a while: I have four large breakfast/brunch joints within pyjama-walking distance from me. How would I survive lazy weekends or killer hangover/post-drinking hunger without them?? My muse of late is Daybreak.

Daybreak has a nice corner location which gets a decent amount of natural light on a sunny day. It's also nice to zone out people watching when you feel like a zombie. Their biggest (and it is really big) downfall is their service. SO UBER SLOW. The first time I was here, I dismissed it as the odd inexperienced server, but I've been here a few more times since then and it's always slow. They are still very friendly though.

Must try item: JUNKYARD FRITTATA. It's pretty much like an omelette/breakfast pizza minus crust. It has a crapload of egg, mushroom, cheese, etc. I managed to finish the entire thing the first time I had it, but that's not recommendable on your arteries and thighs. They have a few menu items that have a mexican flare - not my thing for breakfast. Their regular breakfast is standard, possibly too greasy - but I like that they come with pancakes AND toast! I am always that person that wants the best of sweet and savoury for breakfast.

A point of cuteness that people may not notice otherwise: all their plates are large and white... and in the shape of an egg! :D

1,"this place is the best for late night work delivery!

the house spring rolls are durrrty yums, the house pad thai is a winner and super filling, and the thai shrimp chips with peanut sauce are an awesome way to round out a meal.

really can't go wrong with the super affordable prices the deliciousness all around. be forewarned huge portions, you'll be full after."
2,"Restaurant itself is nothing special. More like a cafeteria style. However, the food was fantastic. Everything was delicious. Everything was very tender and Full of flavour. The naan was  huge and one of the best I've ever eaten. My favourite was the curry fish. Amazing."
2,"Happily upgrading my review to 5 stars.

We went on Sunday, which means that all sorts of things are on discount throughout the evening. Reason: they only open Thursday - Sunday, so they want to get rid of everything on Sunday. Everything is fresh and local.

The Hubster had the burger, which was ABSOLUTELY gigantic. RIght after he ordered and before i could decide on an order, another server scratched it off the menu. Our server made sure that he would get a burger, despite them being out. The burger was apparently very delicious and had a giant piece of pork belly on it. The fries and homemade ketchup were really good.

I had the ribeye steak, which was INCREDIBLY. I asked for it rare, and it came medium rare but it was still really good. That's something I find about beef, if it's really good, I'm totally okay with it being cooked more than I like. If it's NOT good, it's upsetting.

The steak came with a big marrow bone and I opted for a slice of foie gras. INCREDIBLE. I literally have half that steak in my fridge right now, and it looks like I haven't eaten any of it. The thing must have started off at close to 15oz. 

Service was some of the best we've ever had. Our server had this great dry wit that kept cracking me up, and even cracked up the Hubster, the biggest comedy snob in the world (I've made him laugh out loud maybe a dozen times in our decade together). He was also very accommodating, as things kept coming off the menu as they ran out. He would either try to get it for us anyway, or refer us to something that we might like instead.

I love the idea of a restaurant where everything is super fresh and local. It definitely comes out in the flavours and the love that the chef and servers feel for the restaurant comes out in everything else. 

A FANTASTIC meal and just incredible dining experience altogether. We'll definitely be back again.

Oh, and the first time we came, we didn't order food because we thought things were a bit pricy. Considering the quantity and the quality you get, this place is a steal!

The restaurant is also bigger than it looks and has a private party room and an outdoor patio"
1,"Updating my review as they have updated their menu. There are more variety of items and they are quite good. The tataki are still lacking flavour, not enough sauce on them. Especially the beef one, it was a salad with beef on top but no sauce! 

Overall good price and good menu. Location is convenient. The scallop dragon roll is my new fav! 

Fyi, no more discount for take out (no more sign when I last came in) and no cash discounts either."
3,"Nice patio.

Totally mediocre and expensive food.  A tourist trap basically."
2,"Hands down the best halibut & chips on the planet! Nice, thick, fresh fillets. Get the halibut it's worth it. I took a cab from across town and Reliable met every expectation. Definitely a destination for a meal when in Toronto."
2,"I don't drink beer. {she doesn't drink beer? why would she...?}
all my beer drinking connoisseur-type friends LOVE this place, and thus, i find myself frequenting the Bier Markt more than you'd think.

i've been there to schmooz with friends during happy hour, birthday parties, and larger functions and i think the food is excellent. each \""brasserie\"" menu item even has a few suggestions for beers that would go well with it. i mean, if i drank beer, what could be better than brasserie brunch waffles with beer!?

i always get their \""pot of moules\"" and sop up the juicy goodness with \""markt frites\"". seesh, who needs beer when you've got moules and frites!

not sure if the servers are being sympathetic to the fact that i, as a non-beer drinker, keep getting \""dragged\"" to the bier markt, but they have always been really great at making suggestions for other alcohol options."
3,"I went here on a whim with some friends one night not really knowing what this place was. We didn't go for the hot pot type meal, but instead ordered a few of the regular dishes to share: rice with shrimp, stewed pork ribs with potatoes, spicy fried chicken with chillies, some kind of noodles with vegetables, and custard buns. 

All the food was really excellent -- we were pleasantly surprised since we'd never heard of the place before. The fried chicken was delicious and crispy without being greasy, and the noodles had a lot of garlic flavour which I enjoyed. This place differs from your standard Chinese restaurant in that the menu is much smaller, offering a few dishes which are very different from each other rather than an enormous menu with many variations on the same dishes (which is good in its own way, just not what you get here). I'd say it's also a little more expensive than typical Chinatown fare. We were all very pleased with the food and will come back. 

The only downside to this place is that they take cash only, which we were slightly unprepared for, so take note of that if you go. Otherwise an excellent find!"
2,"I visited The Shore Club for their buck a shuck special after 10PM one Friday night. The restaurant/lounge was actually quite empty so seating was available right away. I was quite hungry so on top of ordering oysters, I also got their mussels & fries (starter) and a mac and cheese to share with my friend. The oysters themselves were decent and were accompanied by the usual condiments (i.e. lemon, cocktail sauce, mignonette, and horseradish). The mussels were a pleasant surprise and definitely worth the price - would actually come back just for this dish! Mac and cheese was pretty good too but the highlight here was definitely the seafood!"
2,"Dining Experience: Brunch
Specialty: Farmer Inspired - Seasonal Cooking 
Menu items: Croque Madame, Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich & Eggs Benedict

The County General lives up to the all the buzz and talk you've all been hearing. Its a tiny restaurant located in a big city, serving farmer inspired dishes, with a rustic decor and plating and a fantastic menu.
For all brunch lovers out there, looking for a homey breakfast done right, using fresh ingredients, The County General is the place to be at. As the weather warms in this rather cold city, I long for those warm Sundays where the act of \""brunching\"" becomes a fundamental part of one's weekend.

I would describe brunch at The County General as tasty and comforting with a \""farmy\"" feel to it. Their Croque Madame is certainly representative of that and a crowd pleaser with a decadent cheese melting conception.
The Croque Madame is simply a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a twist. The twist being the soft béchamel sauce, the use of hand crafted specialty cheeses and the added element of a fresh sunny side-up egg.
Served with your choice of french fries or salad, this sandwich is melted ooey-gooey goodness on a hard-wood cutting tray.

Although sandwiches seem to be what drives the Toronto crowds to the County General, it seems their big hit, whether for brunch, lunch or dinner is still the infamous Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.
This sandwich has been praised and talked about all over the city, and its popularity does match its taste. I mean, who would have thought of taking tender pieces of chicken thighs (which in my mind are the best part of a chicken), soaking them in buttermilk, then frying them to perfection and assembling in a mix of avocado chutney, pickled red onions and coriander (aka cilantro), on a milk bun...truly mouth-watering.
The way to eat this sandwich is by squeezing the top bun down until the master piece is bite-able, and then sinking your teeth into what 's about to become a great brunching experience.

Last but not least, I would like to give an honorary mention to County General's Eggs Benny.
Although I can attest I have had better eggs benny experiences, such as the one from the already closed Hoof Cafe (thanks for ruining me for life btw); I would say CG's Eggs Benedict are quite good and worth the try. They tend to be more rustic and dry than your typical benny, but the hollandaise is quite fresh and tasty and the eggs are done just right. So if you are a Benedict fan, you would not go wrong with these.

As a parting thought, I would also like to give a mention to CG's coffee. I had one of the best cappuccinos there. Their coffee is done to perfection and the milk is frothy and fresh. So much so, that I even doubled on my coffee order that day!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."
3,"This place has gone viral lately for their mochi egg waffles but the line was too long when they were hosting free giveaway event so I decided to come another day 
.
I ordered the famously known taro mochi egg waffles with sesame and taro ice cream on top with sprinkles and chocolate syrup. The price kinda threw me off, I was shocked when I had to pay 12bucks for egg waffles 
.
Disappointingly, I couldn't taste any of the mochi inside the egg waffles, not sure if it's because of the ice cream that makes it harder to feel the mochi but nope, I couldn't taste any of it 
When you get to the bottom, the ice cream melts and makes the waffles soggy and taste like taro dough without mochiBUT their ice cream is truly good especially black sesame
.
Overall comment, this is a one-time thing for me cuz nothing really special about it even the mochi egg waffles was just average quality. I'd rather paying less and get the same quality of egg waffles at other places."
2,"I used to eat at Eggspectation all the time when I was a student but thought it shut down when the Yonge Street location disappeared.  I was happy to discover it only moved one street over.  Eggs Benedict is my favourite breakfast meal so my friend and I shared the California Dreaming and the Smoked Salmon Benny.  Both dishes met my expectations and I like that you get a serving of fruit on the side.  For a Sunday morning, the wait wasn't too long like other trendy brunch places.  We only waited about 15 minutes and they text you if you feel like wandering outside for a bit."
2,"If you really want to have a desserts, you may check this place out.
Better then other grocery store.
Mohca taste good!!!"
2,I've tried several middle eastern restaurants / fast food joints in Toronto but this one was far and away the best one we've tried. I'm a big guy (over 6' and 225 lb) and I almost never leave food on my plate but I wasn't able to finish the Kabab Grill plate because of their very generous portion. Particularly tasty was the shish taouk (spelling?) ... very tender and very well seasoned. The pickled vegetables were fantastic and were a great contrast to the grilled meats. We went because of a voucher we won at a charity gala but we'll be back and now I see that they even have a location in Port Credit which is a 5 minute drive. Thanks!
2,I love this place because the Mexican food is delicious and not greasy. The nachos are probably the best I've had and I'm from New York where there is ample Mexican fare! The service was slow at first but then was really attentive. The ambiance is good the resto was full and buzzing but not too loud.  The churro she were perfectly cooked and not dry the inside was soft which is how authentic chirps should be. Great casual spot I loved how we didn't have to worry about lines or a reservation. It's sad the reviews are so low thankfully I didn't look at reviews prior and stopped in because of the cute patio.
3,"Overall,  great crepes and atmosphere. it's a nice snack/desert spot. I ordered Thai crepe and it was so good.  Little bit pricey but it was worth it."
2,"It was my second time trying Burrito Boyz, though my first time at this location. I remember trying it a few years ago and being wowed by the flavours - way more than places like Chipotle or Tejanos BBQ (Montreal). Thankfully, this location did not disappoint.

We ordered 1 burrito each so 3 in total. 1 steak, 1 chicken and 1 fish (haddock). We got large burritos when I found out that the large part isn't the tortilla but rather the portion of protein in the burrito. For $33 total, we were all happy and very satisfied with our respective burrito! 

What I love is the ability to personalize the burrito (whole wheat tortilla, guac - duh - and a variety of chopped vegetables and sauces and beans/rice for those who like that kinda thing). My fave part is at the end when they've made the burrito, they first grill your choice of protein on the grill, then once it's assembled, they toast it which is such a simple but key part of what makes this burrito so great.

I don't think I would get a large if I were to go back because that was too much meat for me but otherwise delicious and will be going back when in the area! One thing to note: there is no seating area so you have to get takeout."
2,Service will always be hit and miss here.. it's weird that when it is less busy it seems to be a worse problem they when its crazy busy. Food is consistently good and the martini's are to die for. Great flavours and super strong. I l also love the patio!
1,"This Druxy's is in the lobby of Princess Margaret Hospital.  Catering options are limited there-Tim Horton's or here.  I can't cope with Tim's coffee anymore so started popping in here instead.  I've only had coffee and snack things so far.  The rest of the food is like any Druxy's I think.

Coffee is decent but the 4 star rating is more for the staff.  They are so friendly and cheerful.  One woman in particular tends to be on the cash register in the mornings and truly does brighten my day.  Yesterday's exchange:
Me: Extra large coffee please.  It's one of those days.
Her: I thought all the days were like that?  Haha!
Too true....
She doesn't have to be so cheerful and smile so genuinely, but she does and I feel energized leaving-even before I've sipped my coffee!

Prices are good too-$1.25 for a large coffee, $1.50 for the extra large/jumbo sized."
2,"Sushi was good but the service was absolutely terrible. The place is tiny so it's not like there were a million tables (there were 4 other than ours). Took an extremely long time to come over and take orders, they never bothered to bring water which was ordered twice, and we waited so long for our bills and then for the machine to pay our bills, we almost walked out. The sushi is not worth the brutal service."
2,"excellent location 
nice decor and lighting
food was good and fresh
only downfall was the filthy unisex washrooms
wait staff, unfriendly 
but that's typical of Asian restaurants."
2,Had a veal chop with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. It was delicious!  Service was excellent.  Would definitely go again.
2,"This place is so lovely. The breakfast scone is so delicious and filling, you must try it if you're there! The front line staff are kind and quick. They start my mornings off right."
2,Tried Roots for the first time. A bit disappointed on the dried and dying cabbage and how little cottage cheese I got... flavour is alright. Healthy option tho!
3,"Ordered a \""large\"" chicken kabob plate ($14). It was the smallest and most expensive plate I've ever received from a shawarma restaurant. Maybe a half cup of rice and half a palm of salad, with all of 2 pcs of radish. The chicken looked really good but was overcooked and bland. The rice was also boring. While the server was nice, after I ordered another person came in and they were informed about a shawarma wrap special (2 for $10) . I would have ordered that if I knew, but it wasn't posted anywhere. 

The best thing I can say is their sauces are amazing, especially that garlic sauce. Regardless, I left hungry & unsatisfied."
2,"If you want to try exotic thai food, this is the place. We went in on saturday night for dinner. Awesome choice. This is a Thai tapas place but definitely the portions are good enough to be a full dish. I ordered Mock thai Mojito and was blown away by the freshness and bursting flavours. We ordered Shrimp chips, papaya salad, and garlic shrimp for starters. each dish was super delicious. I ordered chicken panang curry for main dish. AWESOME!!!! i still cant get the taste out of my head. Trust me i like that. I have tried Khao San Road and Bangkok garden . But this place is something else-its AMAZING!!!

Just one heads-up, call ahead to reserve  table coz since it is so popular i would imagine not getting a walk in table."
2,"Walked in on a whim on Saturday night and found my new favourite K-town spot.

+ Our group was greeted promptly with hot corn tea and menus, which was great because it took a very long time to read through them, and we were hungry.
+ While we sipped Soju and waited for our food, we received a plate of DELICIOUS FRIED EGGS, on the house. WHAT.
+ As previously noted, banchan is bountiful and includes a pickled root vegetable that blew our minds.
+ Unlike other places, the menu offers (amongst its dozens upon dozens of dishes) only a dolsot ($9.10) or regular ($7.10) bibimbap of the beef/veggie variety. I was able to swap the meat out for tofu with no problems at all.
+ I ordered the tobokki (rice cakes with fish cakes, $9.10) \""normal\"" on the \""hot-normal-mild\"" spicy scale, thinking, you know, \""normal\"". Guess what? \""Normal\"" is also hot. IT'S SUPER HOT. I'm leaving this as a plus even though I literally nearly died, in case you like your food spicy, and also because it came with an egg too. WHAT.
+ Haemul Pajun (seafood and green onion pancake, $8/$12) was so tasty. Small was plenty. Good for sharing.
+ I tasted the Doenjang Jigae (soybean stew, $7.10) and it was really yummy, like a super hearty miso.* It came with purple rice and would make the perfect lunch and I'm totally getting it next time.

*Note for those with dietary restrictions: the stew had seafood in it although it was advertised as having only tofu and vegetables - a plus for me but obviously not for a non-seafood eater. So if you have any concerns, double check with your server."
2,"Sadly, Barque comes nowhere near what it purports to be.

Having just returned from a trip to Texas I decided to give it a go, as I was jones-ing for some smoked goodness.

I had the sampler for two, which I split with my wife, with sides of veggies, and fries.

The ribs were stupidly chewy. No 'fall off the bone' here. I've had more enjoyment from a $4. bag of beef jerky. They weren't even smoked all the way through. Same with the sausages. Not smoked through enough. If I want the joy of a real Italian sausage in all its glory, I'll got to an Italian joint, or cook 'em at home.

The chicken was good. Smoked through, and still quite juicy.

The fries were outrageously overloaded with salt. I mean, how can you botch fries? How hard can it be? Toss 'em in the fryer, and sprinkle a pinch of salt on 'em. It ain't rocket science..... I love salty foods, but even those fries were too much.

Now for the vegetables. They were crisp, and fresh, as they should be, but some genius that plans out the menu decided that they would be better if they were 'seasoned' with sesame oil. 

WRONG. You're not an Asian restaurant, you're a smoke house. Don't get cute.... Tasting sesame oil in conjunction with smoked meat doesn't work.

One of the few things that was positive, was the service. The server was prompt, and engaging, even though she was quite busy."
2,"I went there for my first time with a big group of friends as a Christmas gathering dinner. I ordered the fried oyster mushrooms to share with two other friends and the liver as main course. Both were awesome. The liver was more than I expected. There were two pieces of it with my favourite asparagus as decor and bacon and mashed potatoes. There were also lots of veggies on the side with a very small tasty plum (atleast that's what I think it was). The liver melted so quickly once I put it in my mouth. It was a loaded entree and I was so full from it. The price of it was great too, very reasonable. My friend tried the salmon which she gave me a piece to try. It was very delicious and you can tell it's fresh seafood. Most of the guys in my group ordered the steak and they've said good things about it too. 

As for the service, it was awesome as well. Some of my friends were terribly late but the servers kept ensuring that we have enough water and as more of my friends came before we ordered they served us delicious dinner rolls. After ordering our food, a few guys left the table to buy something at a store before it closed nearby. Meanwhile their dishes were ready but they weren't back yet. The servers urged us to call them back quickly because reheating or leaving their food warmed in the kitchen will ruin the true tastes."
2,This shop should be closed and the deposit not returned.  Poorly run and customer service is non existent.  The male manager returns from his smoke break and does not wash his hands before starting to make his next pizza.  If you want ash and we'll smoked pizza then this is your location. Otherwise keep driving or try the food court downstairs.
3,"Never get their green juices. Its pre made and placed in the fridge for purchase. The juice was bland and it tasted like something I could make at home. For almost $7, it is not worth it at all."
2,Super chill spot with a nice relaxing cafe in the back. I came in because it was 31 degrees and I saw the gelato at the window. But the stag let me try all flavours and mix to up even with a small size. If I'm the area. I'd definately return
2,"Never coming back here again. The service was okay, it wasn't the waitress's fault we had a horrible experience, but what in the world do you guys ACTUALLY have that's on the menu? Not even kidding, we ordered about 3-4 different times because every time we ordered something that was on the menu they would come back to us 10 minutes later and tell us it's not available. So after the 3rd attempt at ordering food, this is what went down:

Me:  \""What do you mean it's not available? It's on the menu, just like the last 3 dishes we ordered!! Okay fine, forget about the food, give us a bottle of Charm Soju\"
2,"Sadly, I need to reduce my rating on the Greek Grill. It was the best Greek restaurant I have found in Toronto but in the past year it has changed and not for the better. The service is not great, food quality is not what it once was and daily specials are never available. I still have hopes it will return to way it was a year ago but each time I come I am disappointed. Time to search for a new Greek haunt."
2,"the atmosphere set here is amazing . it manages to be chill and cozy while also giving off that amazing Italian meditterenia vibe . great service and a very kind helpful waitress. we ordered on the more expensive side ,the lamb shank , octopus and black and white pasta were all amazing and are a recommendation to anyone visiting . all in all ,a true 5 star experience in the heart of Oakville"
2,"I came in on a whim since I live close by. The service was friendly and the takeout was fairly quick : under 15 minutes. I had General Tao Chicken. So disappointed! It lacked all the classic General Tao flavours. It was covered in a red sauce but with no salt, garlic, spice, or tang. I feel very ripped off.  I've tried General Tao Chicken from 30+ restaurant's in Toronto. 

On a side note: great portion, great white rice, and fresh veggies.  If you go, please go for the Dumplings! Don't make my mistake."
2,"Buca has a wonderful atmosphere. Bare brick walls and a corridor displaying their meats. Just overall a very pretty restaurant to be in. Their cured meats were excellent but other than that, everything else was not very memorable. We ordered the Patate Pizza which was boring after the first bite and also got the Bigoli pasta which was good, but not great. The servers did their jobs but really weren't friendly at all. Maybe it was an off day for them but I was definitely disappointed in my experience there."
2,"*2.5 stars

Came here twice, both times for the signature Korean sandwiches because I had TeamBuy vouchers. Both times the wait was ridiculously long, especially for a take out place. Might as well have a sit down lunch if its going to take that long, at least I wouldn't be ignored. Didn't help that both times I was given my order later than people who had arrived and ordered after me. 

Thankfully the food was pretty good, particularly the bulgogi cheeseburger with kimchi. You can request hot sauce on the side if you want to add some heat to your sandwich. The second time i went they had chairs at the counters so you could actually sit and eat. 

Both times I received a bit of salad in my box: the first time it had carrots and dressing (which unfortunately made a mess on the sandwich wrapper which was placed in the same box). Second time it was a small bunch of undressed salad greens. 

Don't know if I would go back and pay regular price.. Certainly not until they improve on service and speed!"
2,"Usually pretty good. Just waited 10 min for a badly made Americano... Sigh. Going to the common next time, long lines but you know the wait is worth it."
2,"The place is massive and a good concept with a lot of activities. Food is average. The service is incredibly slow and i do not think it is the waitress. There is something wrong with their process making it very inefficient. Our food arrived before our drinks and we ordered them at the same time. That is unacceptable. The gaming area is a bit cramped and could use a few more, but they have everything you'll need and quite fun."
2,"Very good, will be definitely returning! 

Good selection of food, nice hot sauces, and great prices for the amount of food you get (you dont feel like your getting ripped off)

Was a little annoyed when I went, they never had the dumplings or carnivals available, perhaps its to show the food is 'fresh'"
2,"I bought a piece of their \""world famous\"" banana bread this afternoon.

It was still frozen when I took a bite.  Huh?!  So much for being fresh!  Once it thawed out, there wasn't much taste to it.

It was one of the worst banana bread I've ever had :("
2,"Guys, these are the best croissants in the city, bar none. Always fresh and warm. Great friendly service. The place is cute and tiny and oh so charming. 

Their clafouti is also amazing, if you can resist purchasing a croissant. 

The coffee is horrible (burnt, always burnt, I hate balzacs) but that's not why you come here. YOU COME FOR THE CROISSANTS!"
1,"Simply too good to resist! I had the garlic chicken, with egg fried chicken rice and it is simply the best! I also had the general tso chicken, but I thought the garlic chicken was better? If I remember correctly, it costs a dollar more too? We ordered these under a meal, in which we got wings for basically free! So that was neat! I had shrimp as well, and it's decent, their meals are better!
Overall nice place to sit, decent food, decent price!"
2,"This one is much better than the Kennedy location. The pho was really good and the amount of beef and tripe I got exceeded my expectations. Every time I dig for more meat at the bottom of the bowl there would always be more. I also got the deep fried soft shell crab again but this time it didn't come out that great. The soft shell crab wasn't all that soft. It was already starting to develop a shell so it felt like it had a plastic layer on the crab. I'm gonna stay away from this appetizer from now on and stick with the usual deep fried spring rolls. Overall this place is newer, nicer and has a whole lot of meat in their pho."
2,"First time here for dinner, there was a 20min wait. The food was tasty and the idea of the restaurant was new to me. Got a pound of snow crab legs and shrimps. Both delicious. Medium spicy is a little hotter than we expected. Also got lotus root as a side. These were more than enough food for 2 people. Would come back to try the rice platter and fries"
1,"under the recommendation from a friend i tried this restaurant with a group of 7 ...  this little restaurant that only fits about 25 people, to my surprise was quite good.

although the food did take a long time to come out, the chef explained that it was their sous chefs birthday so she was working the kitchen alone.

we had no problem with the wait after she explained to us very nicely.  

i ordered the oxtail dinner, my friend ordered the fried chicken dinner ... both portions were generous and overall great value.  

the fried chicken was juicy and tasted delicious... i've had better oxtail to be honest.. but they did not stinge on anything.  portions for all their dinners were large.  price was good..

i would return to this hidden gem."
2,"I do not understand the hype aaaaat allll!! 


ok to start I ordered the squid & I asked  for no green onion sprinkled on top. The waitress told me no modifications are allowed. So already I'm kinda of annoyed. 

Finally it comes and it's waaay smaller then I expected and had seen on instagram. 

Then the tacos come and they bring the wrong order, so we wait for ours. 

We got chicken , beef cheek, mushroom & fish. 

Mushroom I didn't even finish , I didn't like 

The rest were all ok...... 

Nothing special 

Wouldn't come back"
3,"Japanese brunch is a cute concept, as the food looks expectedly cuter than a typical North American brunch. But the food really isn't that great, for its price. I got the Sapporo breakfast, the onigiri and tomago rolls are not salted / seasoned, and the salad comes with some mayo. Basically the only thing that had much taste were the sausages, which were nothing special. My companion's donburi dish was a bit more flavourful, but $15 for a bowl of rice, a few pieces of chicken and eggs, seems overpriced. $40 for these 2 dishes and a cup of tea and a cappuccino. I won't return."
2,Cute!  Cute! Cute!  I had an amazing cappuccino and chocolate croissant.  I'll be back for sure.  The girl behind the counter was very nice.
2,"3.5/5! I prefer Guu- but its still good! I recommend the Beef Tataki, Ebi Mayo, Halibut Taco & Fish & Chips Roll! Great service & amazing honeydew flavoured sake!"
2,"Let me start by saying I'm no dim sum expert but I like food and my taste buds work. I was happy with my experience there. 
I enjoyed the variety of food carts that came around. 
The place appears sketchy because of its location(basement restaurant on Dundas St W) but my experience with these hideaways is normally really good food.
My only complaint was my $30+ bill. Wouldn't have been bad but I was alone. I didn't realize all these little dishes would add up. 
Will definitely go back. Food was really good. My faves: chicken feet, and the shrimp rolls."
2,"This is my favorite Thai restaurant, their phad thai is amazing, their green curry is great, and their spring rolls are best I've ever had. The spring rolls are always so hot and oily, I think it's that extra unhealthyness that adds so much flavor to them.

If you're hungry make sure you get the take out instead of dining in, for some reason their takeout portions are about twice the size as what they serve on their plates if you eat inside the restaurant."
2,"The server was very nice In tune with the style of the place !  It has this lovely vibe like you are traveling back in time with the music from pulp fiction . I got the grilled fish sandwich with avocado and diced pineapple on house made milk bun. The grilled tilapia has a nice smoky flavor fresh off the grill but sadly is under seasoned .  But the worst part is the bun it was very dense seems the moisture just trapped inside the bun and made it sort of gummy texture like under baked and it might be better if it were put on flat top and buttered it . Flavor wise since it was under seasoned made it taste bland . Maybe add some mayo would work ...

Cappuccino was excellent ."
2,So sad they took the chicken tinga off the menu and replaced it with a standard chicken taco. The pork taco has also been replaced which makes me even sadder.
1,"This place is lovely to be at! It is probably a sister restaurant of Buster's Sea Cove as the menu items are closely similar but offers alcohol and a bit more class. The prices are on par to the BSC and it has seating which is a win! They have cheaper lunch options that are usually paired with salad or fries. I am in love with their more expensive options like the lobster rigatoni or the seafood linguine which is like heaven in your mouth! Both are packed with a ridiculous amount of seafood and for the price around $20 after tax and tip makes it was a perfect combination of quality food! Honesty, this place is packed so I usually order on ritual and sometimes just head home to enjoy the meal! They nicely seal the meal with glad wrap so it will not leak! 

If you like seafood, this place should be on the top of your list to try! Though it's a shame they dont do any clam ahucklin"
1,"As a vegan I was limited to a handful of items on the menu but what I tried I loved. 

Had the tofu tacos and the papaya salad. Went for the highest level of spice on the taco (so it had habaneros instead of jalapeños) and I was impressed. I love my spice and my mouth was pleasantly smoldering. 

The tortilla was very interesting. Fresh and doughy with a naan/dosa taste and texture. The tofu was very rich and meaty. Didn't taste like tofu at all (a good thing lol).

The papaya salad was fresh and tangy. Perfect accompaniment for the spicy, meaty taco.

Very good food and quite inexpensive. Lots of variety for the omnivores. Highly recommend this place!"
2,"4 stars and here's why. I popped in this afternoon to escape the cold and a greasy spoon, old skool diner wasn't what I was looking, for but it's what I needed - i just didn't know it.

The place wasn't busy, but the service was friendly  and efficient, and the food totally decent, cheap, and abundant. Where else in King West area can you get a full breakfast for $5.99? 

The cherry was when this rather old, and hunched-over gentleman with a cane came in for his weekend breakfast. His name is Mort and he is clearly a regular. 

As Mort took his seat he apologized for sitting at the table in front of me with his back to me as he would have preferred to face me so we could have a conversation. (Does it get anymore classic and charming than this? Not really).

He dropped his cane and I asked if I could help him and he said: no, I'm able with cane.

After a brief pause, we both burst out laughing. Cuz Abel and Cain.. lol!

He was impressed that I got the reference and was like: College educated? Me too. I have good feeling about you. I know people and I have a good feeling about you. Then he fist bumped me.

Then he asked if I was an opera fan. I said, no. He replied: so are you a Sally Rand fan? 

His friend asked if I knew who that was. I said no. Then Mort goes:  if you don't like opera u must like Sally Rand. She was as a nudie dancer. In the 30s if you asked someone if they liked Sally Rand it was, what do you call it? A JOKE!

Outstanding.

If Zupa's is good enough for a class act like Mort, then how can any of us go wrong?"
2,"Save yourself the trouble of driving to this restaurant to eat a fried frozen patty.. Go to the grocery store, buy a package of Lick's frozen burgers, fry up a patty, squirt on some Guk! (also from supermarket) and there you go. You just saved yourself about $12 and the privilege of wondering how clean is that worn out old wood banister? Shudder!"
2,"Love the feel of the restaurant, with open spaces and big windows and natural light. Also super busy, as it filled up quickly and we were only able to get a reservation for 4 for 1030am. Service was also good, but on the whole I was quite disappointed with the food...

I got the eggs Benedict, and it truly was one of the least flavorful eggs Benedict dishes I've had before. I thought the poached egg was watery, the tomato bread a bit burnt, and potatoes somewhat tasteless. I actually had to season quite a bit with salt and pepper to add some flavor to the dish."
2,"This seafood place is absolutely awesome, one of my favorites. They have daily specials almost daily and late night specials everyday. Dozen oysters for 15 dollars and they can mix up the oysters out of what they have in stock!! I also enjoy their Tuesday special which is the seafood tower, it's such good value.

Everyone should try out pearl diver，you will not be disappointed."
1,Cute casual restaurant. The wait staff are pleasant and not pretentious. The food was delicious and reasonably priced! Good place to go to if you are looking for decent yet not extravagant food at a reasonable price.
2,"Came back to pick up their original cheesecake and honey Madeleines for my BF's friend! As I was in line I noticed the Angel Hat was still available but in limited quantities... Around 5 left well 4 after I bought one! I've never tried the Angel Hat since they were always sold out every since it was added to the menu. I've had their original cheesecake and honey Madeleines many times and even their matcha cheesecake but never the Angel Hat! 

It looks like a fluffy dome! My first bite into it and you can tell the cake was so fluffy and light! When it enters your mouth it magically disappears! It's so light that it melts away! My friends and I were amazed! It's like airy and cheesier compared to the cheesecake! Definitely something to try if you've never had it! 

I was glad I didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes to get one! I guess I was lucky!!"
2,"After coming back from Tokyo, we were looking for somewhere in Toronto for Japanese soufflé pancakes, and we found Fuwa Fuwa on Yelp! We ordered the creme brûlée and tiramisu ones and they were very good. The only thing that was a minus was that there isn't really a waiting area and the wait is a bit long. Still, if you got some time and have a dessert craving, come check Fuwa Fuwa"
2,"This place is a little hit or miss. I have only been here for drinks/dancing and never eaten here. Its a large venue and usually pretty easy to get into.
Its not the trendiest place, so sometimes it is way too empty. There are often a few older people who don't quite belong.

Overall the music is usually pretty good. They will play top 40, good house and then some great hip hop and reggae. We usually have a good time on the dance floor."
2,"On our last visit here, we had dinner for 4, and were seated on the patio.  The view was great for people watching, as we were seated right on the Danforth side (there are only 3 tables there).  

I've been to a few greek restaurants on the Danforth, this was not our favourite.  One DC ordered the roasted chicken (ok), another the lamb souvlaki (tasted gamey), chicken souvlaki (ok).  We ordered the \""opa\"" flaming cheese (I forget what that's called) - the flame went out early, so the experience was not as good as it could have been.  We also ordered the dips - one of the cheese dips was extremely salty.  The hummus was ok however.  Being a warm day, I ordered a salad, as the rest of the meal was quite heavy.

Our dining experience was further marred by the adjoining table - consisting of a rude man, and his DC.  He totally freaked out on the staff, the owner, and everyone else, making the atmosphere less than enjoyable, but that's not the fault of Pappas Grill.  Despite the drama, I think I'd choose one of the other places on the Danforth, just cuz the food could have been better."
2,"I came here looking for traditional pho with meat (i did not want anything vegetarian), I specifically wanted chicken pho.  upon reading the menu outside the store front it appeared to be a traditional pho restaurant with the typical queen st. marketing.  i ordered the classic chicken pho and upon receiving my bowl, i immediately noticed there was only tofu in my pho and NO CHICKEN. I was very disappointed to see no chicken meat in my bowl. I enjoy vegetarian and vegan food so instead of sending it back, i decided to give the tofu a ago. the broth does not have a strong taste and is weak. its not as flavourful as other traditional phos. The restaurants pitch is that it doesnt use MSG. and thats great, but any good chef knows other spices should be used to bring flavour to the broth. shit even a little sprinkle of salt and butter would have helped bring flavour to this dish.  i also did not appreciate the noddle, it was a typical rice noodle where I prefer the egg noodle. furthermore, the menu has toppings you can add, including extra \""meat\"". I would suggest paying the extra 2$ and adding the additional portion. I got two thin strips of tofu, this barely seemed like enough. when i order pho, i am typically given a whole chicken breast, which is usually a nice portion size. 2 strips of tofu is hardly comparable.  Overall, the soup seemed to lack content. this place has great potential but they need to tweak a few things."
2,"I ate here this evening and will never go back. The waitress was incredibly rude and picked up my plate as I was literally taking the last piece of sushi off of it to put in my mouth. When we asked for the bill she punched the amount into the machine and walked off with the bill. 

The food was meh, to be honest I'm actually laying down writing this because I have horrible stomach pain and nausea so if I end up having full fledged food poisoning I wouldn't be surprised. 

Never, ever, again."
2,"Went to this place - Portuguese restaurant with a group of best friends on last Saturday. We ordered some of their popular dishes: 1. Portuguese BBQ Chicken (Frango no Churrasco) - one of the most traditional and popular dishes in Portuguese cuisine. This dish is quite healthy and utilizes the natural and zesty flavor of lemon along with a spicy Portuguese paprika kick to make an unbelievably flavorful and hearty dish 2. Flaming sausage, certainly mouth watering delicious dish 3. Roasted Pork 4. Grilled Sardines 5. Red Sangria... All of the food came out so delicious and served on the table with good service. We all enjoyed the dinner in the restaurant throughout the night. Will definitely come back again..."
2,Worst experience ever.  Their food is tolerable but not that tasty if I have other choices I would never go here.  Service is soooo bad.  The staff were not trained properly and was extremely rude.  DO NOT go here!
2,"I'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that Corsa Italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  
The prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what I've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  A server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  Another time our white wine was room temperature.  We brought it up with our server who reminded me of Yosemite Sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a Tea Party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  Yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  While he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  When it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, \""uh, ya, thanks.\"" then printed us a new bill.  
There are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while I appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty \""QSA\"" isn't what St. Clair West needs."
3,"This is absolutely my new favourite place in the city. Legit! 
I LOVE the atmosphere, to say the least. The mechanical bull, line dancing lessons, the music and the decor just make the place an absolute blast! It's so much fun! 

The only thing is that drinks and food are expensive there, but I heard that their wings are pretty amazing. 

I would love to come out for karaoke night. Definitely recommended for lovers of the cowboy/cowgirl experience ;)"
